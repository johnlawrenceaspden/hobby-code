<b>Contract Programmer (Verilog, Assembler, Embedded C, Java, Python, R, OCaml, Lisp, Clojure)</b><br>

<br>
<p>I'm a contractor / consultant programmer living and working in Cambridge, UK. I like challenges.<br>
</p>
<p>I'm good at understanding and solving difficult problems. Having solved them I'm good at explaining the answers.</p>
<p>I've programmed commercially in many languages, from assembler on the bare metal to LISP on the JVM. I can see computer programs in terms of high level abstractions and in terms of nanosecond by nanosecond machine instructions shuffling bits. I can work at various levels of abstraction, and I can translate fluently between levels.<br>
</p>
<p>I'm talkative, literate, lucid and friendly. I'm a good communicator and I write programs that are intended to be read by others. </p>
<p>I have a degree in mathematics from King's College Cambridge. I'm very interested in Machine Learning techniques (especially from a Bayesian perspective).<br>
</p>
<p>I've been fascinated by computers since I was a child. In my spare time I
 program for fun. Recently I've been interested in the new language 
Clojure, which I've been blogging about here: <a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/">http://www.learningclojure.com</a>. Slightly to my amazement, this seems to get about 25,000 readers every month.</p>
<p>I've twice been one of the 'language gurus' for the dev8d academic developer's conference in London.</p>
<p>Currently I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence issues, and the subfield of statistics and computer science known variously as Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Big Data.</p>
<p>I run my own limited company (J.L. Aspden Ltd) and can be hired through it. Please get in touch if you have something difficult to do!</p>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>My latest hobby project is an intelligence test which aims to 'benchmark the brain': It's written in clojure, and lives on heroku.</div>
<div>It's at <a href="http://iqtest.aspden.com">iqtest.aspden.com</a>. Please forgive it if it takes a few seconds to spin up. It goes to sleep when no-one is looking at it.<br>

I wrote software to control the Authentec EIP-190 encryption core in Solarflare's latest very-high-speed networking silicon. I also ended up diving into the chip design itself to correct problems with the way that the core had been wired into the chip, invented a new way of getting the chip simulation to sanity check its internals in minutes rather than weeks, and redesigned the scheduling algorithm in a way that speeded up the simulations without impacting on the real performance.<br>

[It shortened the software development time by several months by directing our optimization efforts, and allowed us to use the CPU we'd originally planned to use, avoiding prohibitively expensive redesign and re-tooling.
