 I advise against this course of action. I have calculated the odds 
against our surviving such an action at three thousand, seven hundred

 No, fuck you, this is exactly the time. The fate of the galaxy is at 
stake. Trillions of lives are hanging in the balance. You just pulled 
four significant digits out of your ass, I want to see you show your 
goddamn work."</p><p><em>"Well, I used the actuarial data from the past 
fifty years, relating to known cases of ships passing through nebulae 
that are interacting with spatial anomalies. There have been 
approximately two million such incidents reported, with only five 
hundred and forty-two incidents in which the ship in question survived 
intact."</em></p><p>"And did you at all take into account that ship 
building technology has improved over the past fifty years, and that 
ours is not necessarily an average ship?"</p><p><em>"Indeed I did, 
Captain. I weighted the cases differently based on how recent they were,
 and how close the ship in question was in build to our own. For 
example, one of the incidents with a happy ending was forty-seven years 
ago, but their ship was a model roughly five times our size. As such, I 
counted the incident as having twenty-four percent of the relevance of a
 standard case."</em></p><p>"But what of our ship's moxie? Can you take determination and drive and the human spirit into account?"</p><p><em>"As
 a matter of fact I can, Captain. In our three-year history together, I 
have observed that both you and this ship manage to beat the odds with a
 measurable regularity. To be exact, we tend to succeed twenty-four 
point five percent more often than the statistics would otherwise 
indicate - and, in fact, that number jumps to twenty-nine point two 
percent specifically in cases where I state the odds against our success
 to three significant digits or greater. I have already taken that 
supposedly 'unknowable' factor into account with my calculations."</em></p><p>"And
 you expect me to believe that you've memorized all these case studies 
and performed this ridiculously complicated calculation in your head 
within the course of a normal conversation?"</p><p><em>"Yes. With all 
due respect to your species, I am not human. While I freely admit that 
you do have greater insight into fields such as emotion, interpersonal 
relations, and spirituality than I do, in the fields of memory and 
calculation, I am capable of feats that would be quite simply impossible
 for you. Furthermore, if I may be perfectly frank, the entire purpose 
of my presence on the bridge is to provide insights such as these to 
help facilitate your command decisions. If you're not going to heed my 
advice, why am I even here?"</em></p><p>"Mm. And we're still sitting at three thousand seven hundred to one against?"</p><p><em>"Three thousand, seven hundred and forty five to one."</em></p><p>"Well, shit. Well, let's go around, then."</p></blockquote><p>The Vulcan your Vulcan could sound like if he wasn't made of straw, I guess? <a href="http://leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=201" rel="nofollow">Link</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At home there was a game that all the parents played with their 
children. It was called, What Did You See? Mara was about Dann’s age 
when she was first called into her father’s room one evening, where he 
sat in his big carved and coloured chair. He said to her, ‘And now we 
are going to play a game. What was the thing you liked best today?’</p>
  
  <p>At first she chattered: ‘I played with my cousin . . . I was out 
with Shera in the garden . . . I made a stone house.’ And then he had 
said, ‘Tell me about the house.’ And she said, ‘I made a house of the 
stones that come from the river bed.’ And he said, ‘Now tell me about 
the stones.’ And she said, ‘They were mostly smooth stones, but some 
were sharp and had different shapes.’ ‘Tell me what the stones looked 
like, what colour they were, what did they feel like.’</p>
  
  <p>And by the time the game ended she knew why some stones were smooth
 and some sharp and why they were different colours, some cracked, some 
so small they were almost sand. She knew how rivers rolled stones along 
and how some of them came from far away. She knew that the river had 
once been twice as wide as it was now. There seemed no end to what she 
knew, and yet her father had not told her much, but kept asking 
questions so she found the answers in herself. Like, ‘Why do you think 
some stones are smooth and round and some still sharp?’ And she thought 
and replied, ‘Some have been in the water a long time, rubbing against 
other stones, and some have only just been broken off bigger stones.’ 
Every evening, either her father or her mother called her in for What 
Did You See? She loved it. During the day, playing outside or with her 
toys, alone or with other children, she found herself thinking, Now 
notice what you are doing, so you can tell them tonight what you saw.</p>
  
  <p>She had thought that the game did not change; but then one evening 
she was there when her little brother was first asked, What Did You See?
 and she knew just how much the game had changed for her. Because now it
 was not just What Did You See? but: What were you thinking? What made 
you think that? Are you sure that thought is true?</p>
  
  <p>When she became seven, not long ago, and it was time for school, 
she was in a room with about twenty children – all from her family or 
from the Big Family – and the teacher, her mother’s sister, said, ‘And 
now the game: What Did You See?’</p>
  
  <p>Most of the children had played the game since they were tiny; but 
some had not, and they were pitied by the ones that had, for they did 
not notice much and were often silent when the others said, ‘I saw . . 
.’, whatever it was. Mara was at first upset that this game played with 
so many at once was simpler, more babyish, than when she was with her 
parents. It was like going right back to the earliest stages of the 
game: ‘What did you see?’ ‘I saw a bird.’ ‘What kind of a bird?’ ‘It was
 black and white and had a yellow beak.’ ‘What shape of beak? Why do you
 think the beak is shaped like that?’</p>
  
  <p>Then she saw what she was supposed to be understanding: Why did one
 child see this and the other that? Why did it sometimes need several 
children to see everything about a stone or a bird or a person?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Tags like "stupid," "bad at <em>_</em>_", "sloppy," and 
so on, are ways of saying "You're performing badly and I don't know 
why." Once you move it to "you're performing badly because you have the 
wrong fingerings," or "you're performing badly because you don't 
understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague personal failing but
 a causal necessity. Anyone who never understood limits will flunk 
calculus. It's not you, it's the bug.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html" rel="nofollow">celandine13</a>

<blockquote>
  <p>When confronting something which may be either a <strong>windmill</strong> or an <strong>evil giant</strong>, what question should you be asking?</p>
  
  <p>There are some who ask, "If we do nothing, and that <strong>is</strong> an evil giant, can we afford to be wrong?"  These people consider themselves to be brave and vigilant.</p>
  
  <p>Some ask "If we attack it wrongly, can we afford to pay to replace a
 windmill?"  These people consider themselves cautious and pragmatic.</p>
  
  <p>Still others ask, "With the cost of being wrong so high in <strong>either</strong>
 case, shouldn't we always definitively answer the 'windmill vs. giant' 
question before we act?"  And those people consider themselves objective
 and wise.</p>
  
  <p>But only a tiny few will ask, "Isn't the fact that we're giving 
equal consideration to the existence of evil giants and windmills a 
warning sign of insanity in ourselves?"</p>
  
  <p>It's hard to find out what these people consider themselves, because they never get invited to parties.</p></blockquote>

<p>From a BBC interview with a retiring Oxford Don:</p>

<p>Don:  "Up until the age of 25, I believed that 'invective' was a synonym for 'urine'."</p>

<p>BBC:  "Why ever would you have thought that?"</p>

<p>Don:  "During my childhood, I read many of the Edgar Rice Burroughs 
'Tarzan' stories, and in those books, whenever a lion wandered into a 
clearing, the monkeys would leap into the trees and 'cast streams of 
invective upon the lion's head.'"</p>

<p>BBC:  long pause "But, surely sir, you now know the meaning of the word."</p>

<p>Don:  "Yes, but I do wonder under what other misapprehensions I continue to labour."</p>

<blockquote><p>And here, according to Trout, was the reason human beings
 could not reject ideas because they were bad: Ideas on Earth were 
badges of friendship or enmity. Their content did not matter. Friends 
agreed with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed
 with enemies, in order to express enmity. The ideas Earthlings held 
didn’t matter for hundreds of thousands of years, since they couldn’t do
 much about them anyway. Ideas might as well be badges as anything.</p></blockquote><p>Kurt Vonnegut, Breakfast of Champions</p>

<p>On <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Correspondence_bias">the error of failing to appreciate your opponents three-dimensionality</a>:</p><blockquote><p>They
 had cliche answers but only to their self-created straw-men. To 
exaggerate only slightly, they had never talked to anyone who really 
believed, and had thought deeply about, views drastically different from
 their own. As a result, when they heard real arguments instead of 
caricatures, they had no answers, only amazement that such views could 
be expressed by someone who had the external characteristics of being a 
member of the intellectual community, and that such views could be 
defended with apparent cogency. Never have I been more impressed with 
the advice I once received: "You cannot be sure that you are right 
unless you understand the arguments against your views better than your 
opponents do."</p></blockquote><p>Source: Milton Friedman, "Schools at Chicago," from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Indispensable-Milton-Friedman-Economics/dp/1596988088" rel="nofollow">The Indispensable Milton Friedman</a></p><p>H/T <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/10/friedman_on_chi.html" rel="nofollow">David Henderson at EconLog</a></p><p>Note: The final sentence of the passage, as presented by Henderson, is missing closing quotation marks.

<p>Hofstadter on the necessary strangeness of scientific explanations:</p><blockquote><p>It
 is no accident, I would maintain, that quantum mechanics is so wildly 
counterintuitive. Part of the nature of explanation is that it <em>must</em>
 eventually hit some point where further probing only increases opacity 
rather than decreasing it. Consider the problem of understanding the 
nature of solids. You might wonder where solidity comes form. What if 
someone said to you, "The ultimate basis of this brick's solidity is 
that it is composed of a stupendous number of eensy weensy bricklike 
objects that themselves are rock-solid"? You might be interested to 
learn that bricks are composed of micro-bricks, but the initial question
 - "What accounts for solidity?" - has been thoroughly begged. What we 
ultimately want is for solidity to vanish, to dissolve, to disintegrate 
into some totally different kind of phenomenon with which we have no 
experience. Only then, when we have reached some completely novel, alien
 level will we feel that we have <em>really</em> made progress in explaining the top-level phenomenon.</p><p>[...]</p><p>I first saw this thought expressed in the stimulating book <em>Patterns of Discovery</em> by Norwood Russell Hanson. Hanson attributes it to a number of thinkers, such as Isaac Newton, who wrote, in his famous work <em>Opticks</em>:
 "The parts of all homogeneal hard Bodies which fully touch one another,
 stick together very strongly. And for explaining how this may be, some 
have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging the Question." Hanson also 
quotes James Clerk Maxwell (from an article entitled "Atom"): "We may 
indeed suppose the atom elastic, but this is to endow it with the very 
property for the explanation of which... the atomic constitution was 
originally assumed." Finally, here is a quote Hanson provides from 
Werner Heisenberg himself: "If atoms are really to explain the origin of
 color and smell of visible material bodies, then they cannot possess 
properties like color and smell." So, although it is not an original 
thought, it is useful to bear in mind that <em>greeness disintegrates</em>.</p></blockquote><p>— from the postscript to <em>Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</em>, in <em>Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern</em> (his lovely book of essays from his column in Scientific American)</p>

<p>It is not really a quote, but a good quip from an otherwise lame recent <a href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/04/complexity-of-soul.html" rel="nofollow">internet discussion</a>:</p>

<p>Matt:
Ok, for all of the people responding above who admit to <em>not</em> 
having a soul, I think this means that it is morally ok for me to do 
anything I want to you, just as it is morally ok for me to turn off my 
computer at the end of the day. Some of us do have souls, though.</p>

<p>Igor:
Matt - I agree that people who need a belief in souls to understand the 
difference between killing a person and turning off a computer should 
just continue to believe in souls.</p>

<blockquote><p>Doctor Slithingly watched the readout on the computer

‘Excellent,’ he muttered, his voice a thin, rasping hiss. ‘Excellent!’ 
He laughed to himself in a chilling falsetto. ‘Soon my plan will come to
 fruition. Soon I will destroy them all!’ The room resounded with the 
sound of his insane giggling.
This was the culmination of years of research – years of testing tissue 
samples and creating unnatural biological hybrids – but now it was over.
 Now, finally, he would destroy them all – every single type and 
variation of leukaemia. In doing so, he would render useless the work of
 thousands of charitable organisations as well as denying medical 
professionals the world over a source of income. He would prevent the 
publication of hundreds of inspiring stories of survival and sacrifice 
which might otherwise have sold millions of copies worldwide.
‘Bwahaha!’ he laughed. ‘So long, you meddling haematological neoplasm,

<blockquote><p>"...I always rejoice to hear of your being still employ'd
 in experimental Researches into Nature, and of the Success you meet 
with. The rapid Progress true Science now makes, occasions my regretting
 sometimes that I was born so soon. It is impossible to imagine the 
Height to which may be carried, in a thousand years, the Power of Man 
over Matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large Masses of their 
Gravity, and give them absolute Levity, for the sake of easy Transport. 
Agriculture may diminish its Labor and double its Produce; all Diseases 
may by sure means be prevented or cured, not excepting even that of Old 
Age, and our Lives lengthened at pleasure even beyond the antediluvian 
Standard. O that moral Science were in as fair a way of Improvement, 
that Men would cease to be Wolves to one another, and that human Beings 
would at length learn what they now improperly call Humanity!"</p></blockquote><p>-- Benjamin Franklin, Letter to Joseph Priestley, 8 Feb 1780</p>

<blockquote><p>This time he covered a lot more ground and was willing to
 talk about the mundane details of presidential existence. “You have to 
exercise,” he said, for instance. “Or at some point you’ll just break 
down.” You also need to remove from your life the day-to-day problems 
that absorb most people for meaningful parts of their day. “You’ll see I
 wear only gray or blue suits,” he said. “I’m trying to pare down 
decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or 
wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.” He mentioned 
research that shows the simple act of making decisions degrades one’s 
ability to make further decisions. It’s why shopping is so exhausting.

<blockquote><p>In a class I taught at Berkeley, I did an experiment 
where I wrote a simple little program that would let people type either 
"f" or "d" and would predict which key they were going to push next. 
It's actually very easy to write a program that will make the right 
prediction about 70% of the time. Most people don't really know how to 
type randomly. They'll have too many alternations and so on. There will 
be all sorts of patterns, so you just have to build some sort of 
probabilistic model. Even a very crude one will do well. I couldn't even
 beat my own program, knowing exactly how it worked. I challenged people
 to try this and the program was getting between 70% and 80% prediction 
rates. Then, we found one student that the program predicted <em>exactly</em> 50% of the time. We asked him what his secret was and he responded that he "just used his free will."</p></blockquote><p>-- <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec18.html" rel="nofollow">Scott Aaronson</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Once upon a time, there was a man who was riding in a 
horse drawn carriage and traveling to go take care of some affairs; and 
in the carriage there was also a very big suitcase. He told the driver 
to of the carriage to drive non-stop and the horse ran extremely fast. <br><br>
Along the road, there was an old man who saw them and asked, “Sir, you seem anxious, where do you need to go?” <br><br>
The man in the carriage then replied in a loud voice, “I need to go to 
the state of Chu.” The old man heard and laughing he smiled and said, 
“You are going the wrong way. The state of Chu is in the south, how come
 you are going to to the north?” <br><br>
“That’s alright,” The man in the carriage then said, “Can you not see? My horse runs very fast.” <br><br>
“Your horse is great, but your path is incorrect.” <br><br>
“It’s no problem, my carriage is new, it was made just last month.” <br><br>
“Your carriage is brand new, but this is not the road one takes to get to Chu.” <br><br>
“Old Uncle, you don’t know,” and the man in the carriage pointed to the 
suitcase in the back and said, “In that suitcase there’s alot of money. 
No matter how long the road is, I am not afraid.” <br><br>
“You have lots of money, but do not forget, The direction which you are 
going is wrong. I can see, you should go back the direction which you 
came from.” <br><br>
The man in the carriage heard this and irritated said, “I have already 
been traveling for ten days, how can you tell me to go back from where I
 came?” He then pointed at the carriage driver and said, “Take a look, 
he is very young, and he drives very well, you needn’t worry. Goodbye!” <br><br>
And then he told the driver to drive forward, and the horse ran even faster.</p></blockquote><p>--Chinese Tale</p>

<blockquote><p>The fear people have about the idea of adherence to 
protocol is rigidity. They imagine mindless automatons, heads down in a 
checklist, incapable of looking out their windshield and coping with the
 real world in front of them. But what you find, when a checklist is 
well made, is exactly the opposite. The checklist gets the dumb stuff 
out of the way, the routines your brain shouldn’t have to occupy itself 
with (Are the elevator controls set? Did the patient get her antibiotics
 on time? Did the managers sell all their shares? Is everyone on the 
same page here?), and lets it rise above to focus on the hard stuff 
(Where should we land?).</p><p>Here are the details of one of the 
sharpest checklists I’ve seen, a checklist for engine failure during 
flight in a single-engine Cessna airplane—the US Airways situation, only
 with a solo pilot. It is slimmed down to six key steps not to miss for 
restarting the engine, steps like making sure the fuel shutoff valve is 
in the OPEN position and putting the backup fuel pump switch ON. But 
step one on the list is the most fascinating. It is simply: FLY THE 
AIRPLANE. Because pilots sometimes become so desperate trying to restart
 their engine, so crushed by the cognitive overload of thinking through 
what could have gone wrong, they forget this most basic task. FLY THE 
AIRPLANE. This isn’t rigidity. This is making sure everyone has their 
best shot at survival.</p></blockquote><p>-- Atul Gawande, <em>The Checklist Manifesto</em></p>

<blockquote><p>In Munich in the days of the great theoretical physicist 
Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1954), trolley cars were cooled in summer by two
 small fans set into their ceilings. When the trolley was in motion, air
 flowing over its top would spin the fans, pulling warm air out of the 
cars. One student noticed that although the motion of any given fan was 
fairly random—fans could turn either clockwise or counterclockwise—the 
two fans in a single car nearly always rotated in opposite directions. 
Why was this? Finally he brought the problem to Sommerfeld.</p><p>“That 
is easy to explain,” said Sommerfeld. “Air hits the fan at the front of 
the car first, giving it a random motion in one direction. But once the 
trolley begins to move, a vortex created by the first fan travels down 
the top of the car and sets the second fan moving in precisely the same 
direction.”</p><p>“But, Professor Sommerfeld,” the student protested, 
“what happens is in fact the opposite! The two fans nearly always rotate
 in different directions.”</p><p>“Ahhhh!” said Sommerfeld. “But of course that is even <em>easier</em> to explain.”</p></blockquote><p>Devine and Cohen, <a href="http://lab.rockefeller.edu/cohenje/PDFs/BookDevineCohenAbsoluteZeroGravity1992.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>Absolute Zero Gravity</em></a>, p. 96.</p>

<blockquote><p>In some species of Anglerfish, the male is much smaller 
than the female and incapable of feeding independently. To survive he 
must smell out a female as soon as he hatches. He bites into her 
releasing an enzime which fuses him to her permanently. He lives off her
 blood for the rest of his life, providing her with sperm whenever she 
needs it. Females can have multiple males attached. The morale is 
simple: males are parasites, women are sluts. Ha! Just kidding! The 
moral is don't treat actual animal behavior like a fable. Generally 
speaking, animals have no interest in teaching you anything.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://oglaf.com/bugfuck/epilogue/" rel="nofollow">Oglaf</a> (Original comic NSFW)</p>

<blockquote><p>The person who says, as almost everyone does say, that 
human life is of infinite value, not to be measured in mere material 
terms, is talking palpable, if popular, nonsense. If he believed that of
 his own life, he would never cross the street, save to visit his doctor
 or to earn money for things necessary to physical survival. He would 
eat the cheapest, most nutritious food he could find and live in one 
small room, saving his income for frequent visits to the best possible 
doctors. He would take no risks, consume no luxuries, and live a long 
life. If you call it living. If a man really believed that other 
people's lives were infinitely valuable, he would live like an ascetic, 
earn as much money as possible, and spend everything not absolutely 
necessary for survival on CARE packets, research into presently 
incurable diseases, and similar charities.</p><p>In fact, people who 
talk about the infinite value of human life do not live in either of 
these ways. They consume far more than they need to support life. They 
may well have cigarettes in their drawer and a sports car in the garage.
 They recognize in their actions, if not in their words, that physical 
survival is only one value, albeit a very important one, among many.</p><p>-- David D. Friedman, <em>The Machinery of Freedom</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A little long, but I don't see the possibility of a good cut:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the 
best? I will tell you now.” He touched the tip of his little finger 
lightly to his eyelid. “The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart 
of it.</p>
  
  <p>“Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to 
lands strange and wonderful, and when they return their captains fetch 
queer animals to the Sealord’s menagerie. Such animals as you have never
 seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as 
stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers 
that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with scythes 
for claws. Syrio Forel has seen these things.</p>
  
  <p>“On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and 
the Sealord sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had 
been sent away, none could say why. When I came into his presence, he 
was seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of 
his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the 
sunrise. ‘Have you ever seen her like?’ he asked of me.</p>
  
  <p>“And to him I said, ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a 
thousand like him,’ and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named 
the first sword.”</p>
  
  <p>Arya screwed up her face. “I don’t understand.”</p>
  
  <p>Syrio clicked his teeth together. “The cat was an ordinary cat, no 
more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. 
How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only 
fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What 
curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten 
fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and 
that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?”</p>
  
  <p>Arya thought about it. “You saw what was there.”</p>
  
  <p>“Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies 
and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your
 eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose.
 Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that 
way knowing the truth.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"However, there is something they value more than a man's life: a trowel."</p><p>"Why a trowel?"</p><p>"If
 a bricklayer drops his trowel, he can do no more work until a new one 
is brought up. For months he cannot earn the food that he eats, so he 
must go into debt. The loss of a trowel is cause for much wailing. But 
if a man falls, and his trowel remains, men are secretly relieved. The 
next one to drop his trowel can pick up the extra one and continue 
working, without incurring debt."</p><p>Hillalum was appalled, and for a
 frantic moment he tried to count how many picks the miners had brought.
 Then he realized. "That cannot be true. Why not have spare trowels 
brought up? Their weight would be nothing against all the bricks that go
 up there. And surely the loss of a man means a serious delay, unless 
they have an extra man at the top who is skilled at bricklaying. Without
 such a man, they must wait for another one to climb from the bottom."</p><p>All the pullers roared with laughter. "We cannot fool this one," Lugatum said with much amusement.</p></blockquote><p>Ted Chiang, <em>Tower of Babylon</em></p>

<p>A long one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . once upon a time men lived among the giants, who were like 
themselves but far more powerful, and these giants always had a supply 
of bread, fruit, milk, and all that was necessary to sustain life, which
 they must have acquired in ways that cost them little, for they would 
always give away their goods to whoever knew how to please them.  And 
the giants would also carry them wherever they wanted to go, provided 
they asked in the proper way.  So it came about that men never thought 
of working, nor of walking, nor of building wagons or ships; instead 
they became natural orators, and spent all of their time watching the 
giants, figuring out what would please or displease them, smiling at 
them or imploring them with tears in their eyes; or else simply 
pronouncing the necessary words, which had to be memorized exactly, 
though they had no understanding of the changes of humor that would come
 over the giants, their brusque refusals, or their sudden willingness.  
Now, if some man, in those days, had tried to get something for himself 
by his own industry, they would have laughed him to scorn; for the 
results of his labor would have been puny beside the immense provisions 
the giants had amassed; and besides with one false step the giants could
 easily have crushed those little beginnings of labor out of existence. 
 That is why all human wisdom came down to knowing how to speak and how 
to persuade; and, rather than move things about with great effort, men 
chose to learn what words it would take to get one of the giants to do 
their moving.  In short, their main business, or rather their only 
business, was to please, and above all not to displease, their 
incomprehensible masters, who seemed nevertheless to be charged with 
nourishing them and housing them and transporting them, and who 
eventually carried out their duties, provided they were prayed to.  This
 kind of existence, in which men never knew whether they were the 
masters or the slaves, lasted for a long time, so that the habit of 
asking, of hoping, of counting on those stronger than themselves left 
indelible traces in human nature. . . . That is why, as if they were 
still waiting for the return of the giants, men do not forget to pray 
and make offerings, though no giant has ever shown himself . . .</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tautological emptiness of a Master's Wisdom is exemplified in 
the inherent stupidity of proverbs. Let us engage in a mental experiment
 by way of trying to construct proverbial wisdom out of the relationship
 between terrestrial life, its pleasures, and its Beyond. If ones says, 
"Forget about the afterlife, about the Elsewhere, seize the day, enjoy 
life fully here and now, it's the only life you've got!" it sounds deep.
 If one says exactly the opposite ("Do not get trapped in the illusory 
and vain pleasures of earthly life; money, power, and passions are all 
destined to vanish into thin air - think about eternity!"), it also 
sounds deep. If one combines the two sides ("Bring Eternity into your 
everyday life, live your life on this earth as if it is already 
permeated by Eternity!"), we get another profound thought. Needless to 
add, the same goes for it's inversion: "Do not try in vain to bring 
together Eternity and your terrestrial life, accept humbly that you are 
forever split between Heaven and Earth!" If, finally, one simply gets 
perplexed by all these reversals and claims: "Life is an enigma, do not 
try to penetrate its secrets, accept the beauty of its unfathomable 
mystery!" the result is, again, no less profound than its reversal: "Do 
not allow yourself to be distracted by false mysteries that just 
dissimulate the fact that, ultimately, life is very simple - it is what 
it is, it is simply here without reason and rhyme!" Needless to add 
that, by uniting mystery and simplicity, one again obtains a wisdom: 
"The ultimate, unfathomable mystery of life resides in its very 
simplicity, in the simple fact that there is life."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Patrician took a sip of his beer. "I have told this to few 
people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I 
was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a
 stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight,
 I'm sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived 
into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and 
dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was
 still alive, the body split and I remember to its day the sweet 
pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the 
baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One 
of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother 
and children. And that's when I first learned about evil. It is built in
 to the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there
 is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to 
become his moral superior."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the discovery of computers and the thinking about computers has 
turned out to be extremely useful in many branches of human reasoning. 
For instance, we never really understood how lousy our understanding of 
languages was, the theory of grammar and all that stuff, until we tried 
to make a computer which would be able to understand language. We tried 
to learn a great deal about psychology by trying to understand how 
computers work. There are interesting philosophical questions about 
reasoning, and relationship, observation, and measurement and so on, 
which computers have stimulated us to think about anew, with new types 
of thinking. And all I was doing was hoping that the computer-type of 
thinking would give us some new ideas, if any are really needed.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A newspaper is better than a magazine. A seashore is a

 single word: kite. As you reread the paragraph, feel the prior 
discomfort of something amiss shifting to a pleasing sense of rightness.
 Everything fits; every sentence works and has meaning. Reread the 
paragraph again; it is impossible to regain the sense of not 
understanding. In an instant, without due conscious deliberation, the 
paragraph has been irreversibly infuesed with a feeling of knowing.</p><p>Try
 to imagine other interpretations for the paragraph. Suppose I tell you 
that this is a collaborative poem written by a third-grade class, or a

<p>On the difficulties of correctly fine-tuning your signaling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I once expressed mild surprise at the presence of a garden gnome in
 an upper-middle-class garden …. The owner of the garden explained that 
the gnome was “ironic”. I asked him, with apologies for my ignorance, 
how one could tell that his garden gnome was supposed to be an ironic 
statement, as opposed to, you know, just a gnome. He rather sniffily 
replied that I only had to look at the rest of the garden for it to be 
obvious that the gnome was a tounge-in-cheek joke.</p>
  
  <p>But surely, I persisted, garden gnomes are always something of a 
joke, in any garden—I mean, no-one actually takes them seriously or 
regards them as works of art. His response was rather rambling and 
confused (not to mention somewhat huffy), but the gist seemed to be that
 while the lower classes saw gnomes as intrinsically amusing, his gnome 
was amusing only because of its incongruous appearance in a “smart” 
garden. In other words, council-house gnomes were a joke, but his gnome 
was a joke about council-house tastes, effectively a joke about class….</p>
  
  <p>The man’s reaction to my questions clearly defined him as 
upper-middle, rather than upper class. In fact, his pointing out that 
the gnome I had noticed was “ironic” had already demoted him by half a 
class from my original assessment. A genuine member of the upper classes
 would either have admitted to a passion for garden gnomes … or said 
something like “Ah yes, my gnome. I’m very fond of my gnome.” and left 
me to draw my own conclusions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people don't know the basic scientific facts about 
happiness—about what brings it and what sustains it—and so they don't 
know how to use their money to acquire it. It is not surprising when 
wealthy people who know nothing about wine end up with cellars that 
aren't that much better stocked than their neighbors', and it should not
 be surprising when wealthy people who know nothing about happiness end 
up with lives that aren't that much happier than anyone else's. Money is
 an opportunity for happiness, but it is an opportunity that people 
routinely squander because the things they think will make them happy 
often don't.</p></blockquote>

<p>From "If money doesn't make you happy, then you probably aren't 
spending it right" by Elizabeth W. Dunn, Daniel T. Gilbert, Timothy D. 
Wilson in the Journal of Consumer Psychology.

<blockquote><p>There is something about practical things that knocks us 
off our philosophical high horses. Perhaps Heraclitus really thought he 
couldn't step in the same river twice. Perhaps he even received tenure 
for that contribution to philosophy. But suppose some other ancient had 
claimed to have as much right as Heraclitus did to an ox Heraclitus had 
bought, on the grounds that since the animal had changed, it wasn't the 
same one he had bought and so was up for grabs. Heraclitus would have 
quickly come up with some ersatz, watered-down version of identity of 
practical value for dealing with property rights, oxen, lyres, 
vineyards, and the like. And then he might have wondered if that 
watered-down vulgar sense of identity might be a considerably more 
valuable concept than a pure and philosophical sort of identity that 
nothing has.</p></blockquote><p>John Perry, introduction to <em>Identity, Personal Identity, and the Self</em></p>

<blockquote><p>A lot of outcomes about which we care deeply are not very
 predictable. For example, it is not comforting to members of a graduate
 school admissions committee to know that only 23% of the variance in 
later faculty ratings of a student can be predicted by a unit weighting 
of the student's undergraduate GPA, his or her GRE score, and a measure 
of the student's undergraduate institution selectivity -- but that is 
opposed to 4% based on those committee members' global ratings of the 
applicant. We <em>want</em> to predict outcomes important to us. It is 
only rational to conclude that if one method (a linear model) does not 
predict well, something else may do better. What is not rational -- in 
fact, it's irrational -- is to conclude that this "something else" 
necessarily exists and, in the absence of any positive supporting 
evidence, is intuitive global judgment.</p></blockquote><p>Hastie  Dawes, <em>Rational Choice in an Uncertain World</em>, pp. 67-8.</p>

<p>From Thomas Macaulay's 1848 <em>History of England</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[W]e are under a deception similar to that which misleads the 
traveler in the Arabian desert. Beneath the caravan all is dry and bare;
 but far in advance, and far in the rear, is the semblance of refreshing
 waters... A similar illusion seems to haunt nations through every stage
 of the long progress from poverty and barbarism to the highest degrees 
of opulence and civilization. But if we resolutely chase the mirage 
backward, we shall find it recede before us into the regions of fabulous
 antiquity. It is now the fashion to place the golden age of England in 
times when noblemen were destitute of comforts the want of which would 
be intolerable to a modern footman, when farmers and shopkeepers 
breakfasted on loaves the very sight of which would raise a riot in a 
modern workhouse, when to have a clean shirt once a week was a privilege
 reserved for the higher class of gentry, when men died faster in the 
purest country air than they now die in the most pestilential lanes of 
our towns, and when men died faster in the lanes of our towns than they 
now die on the coast of Guiana.</p></blockquote>

<p>.................................</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We too shall in our turn be outstripped, and in our turn be envied.
 It may well be, in the twentieth century, that the peasant of 
Dorsetshire may think himself miserably paid with twenty shillings a 
week; that the carpenter at Greenwich may receive ten shillings a day; 
that laboring men may be as little used to dine without meat as they are
 now to eat rye bread; that sanitary police and medical discoveries may 
have added several more years to the average length of human life; that 
numerous comforts and luxuries which are now unknown, or confined to a 
few, may be within the reach of every diligent and thrifty workingman. 
And yet it may then be the mode to assert that the increase of wealth 
and the progress of science have benefited the few at the expense of the
 many, and to talk of the reign of Queen Victoria as the time when 
England was truly merry England, when all classes were bound together by
 brotherly sympathy, when the rich did not grind the faces of the poor, 
and when the poor did not envy the splendor of the rich.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Day ends, market closes up or down, reporter looks for good or bad

  <p>Sometimes you hear philosophers bemoaning the fact that 
philosophers tend not to form consensuses like certain other disciplines
 do (sciences in particular). But there is no great mystery to this. The
 sciences reward consensus-forming as long as certain procedures are 
followed: agreements through experimental verification, processes of 
peer review, etc. Philosophy has nothing like this. Philosophers are 
rewarded for coming up with creative reasons not to agree with other 
people. The whole thrust of professional philosophy is toward inventing 
ways to regard opposing arguments as failure, as long as those ways 
don't exhibit any obvious flaws. However much philosophers are 
interested in the truth, philosophy as a profession is not structured so
 as to converge on it; it is structured so as to have the maximal 
possible divergence that can be sustained given common conventions. We 
are not trained to find ways to come to agree with each other; we are 
trained to find ways to disagree with each other.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A few years into this book, I was diagnosed as diabetic 
and received a questionnaire in the mail. The insurance carrier stated 
that diabetics often suffer from depression and it was worried about me.
 One of the questions was “Do you think about death?” Yes, I do. “How 
often?” the company wanted to know. “Yearly? Monthly? Weekly? Daily?” 
And if daily, how many times per day? I dutifully wrote in, “About 70 
times per day.” The next time I saw my internist, she told me the 
insurer had recommended psychotherapy for my severe depression. I 
explained to her why I thought about death all day—merely an 
occupational hazard—and she suggested getting therapy nonetheless. I 
thought, fine, it might help with the research.</p><p>The therapist 
found me tragically undepressed, and I asked her if she could help me 
design a new life that would maximize the few years that I had left. 
After all, one should have a different life strategy at sixty than at 
twenty. She asked why I thought I was going to die and why I had such a 
great fear of death. I said, I am going to die. It’s not a fear; it’s a 
reality. There must be some behavior that could be contraindicated for a
 man my age but other normally dangerous behavior that takes advantage 
of the fact that I am risking fewer years at sixty or sixty-five years 
of age than I was at twenty or twenty-five (such as crimes that carry a 
life sentence, crushing at age twenty but less so at age sixty-five). 
Surely psychology must have something to say on the topic. Turns out, 
according to my therapist, it does not. There was therapy for those with
 terminal illness, for the bereaved, for the about-to-be-bereaved, for 
professionals who dealt with terminal patients, and so on, but there was
 nothing for people who were simply aware that their life would come to a
 natural end. It would seem to me that this is a large, untapped market.
 The therapist advised me not to think about death.</p></blockquote><p>Dick Teresi, <em>The Undead</em></p>

<blockquote><p>"Ten thousand years' worth of sophistry doesn't vanish 
overnight," Margit observed dryly. "Every human culture had expended 
vast amounts of intellectual effort on the problem of coming to terms 
with death. Most religions had constructed elaborate lies about it, 
making it out to be something other than it was—though a few were 
dishonest about life, instead. But even most secular philosophies were 
warped by the need to pretend that death was for the best."</p><p>"It 
was the naturalistic fallacy at its most extreme—and its most 
transparent, but that didn't stop anyone. Since any child could tell you
 that death was meaningless, contingent, unjust, and abhorrent beyond 
words, it was a hallmark of sophistication to believe otherwise. Writers
 had consoled themselves for centuries with smug puritanical fables 
about immortals who'd long for death—who'd beg for death. It would have 
been too much to expect all those who were suddenly faced with the 
reality of its banishment to confess that they'd been whistling in the 
dark. And would-be moral philosophers—mostly those who'd experienced no 
greater inconvenience in their lives than a late train or a surly 
waiter—began wailing about the destruction of the human spirit by this 
hideous blight. We needed death and suffering, to put steel into our 
souls! Not horrible, horrible freedom and safety!"</p></blockquote><p>-- Greg Egan, "Border Guards".</p>

<blockquote><p>Let me differentiate between scientific method and the 
neurology of the individual scientist. Scientific method has always 
depended on feedback [or flip-flopping as the Tsarists call it]; I 
therefore consider it the highest form of group intelligence thus far 
evolved on this backward planet. The individual scientist seems a 
different animal entirely. The ones I've met seem as passionate, and 
hence as egotistic and prejudiced, as painters, ballerinas or even, God 
save the mark, novelists. My hope lies in the feedback system itself, 
not in any alleged saintliness of the individuals in the system.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_1.html?page=21&amp;full_article=yes" rel="nofollow">Robert Anton Wilson</a></p>

<blockquote><p>In 2002, Wizards of the Coast put out Star Wars: The Trading Card Game designed by Richard Garfield.</p><p>As
 Richard modeled the game after a miniatures game, it made use of many 
six-sided dice. In combat, cards' damage was designated by how many 
six-sided dice they rolled. Wizards chose to stop producing the game due
 to poor sales. One of the contributing factors given through market 
research was that gamers seem to dislike six-sided dice in their trading
 card game.</p><p>Here's the kicker. When you dug deeper into the 
comments they equated dice with "lack of skill." But the game rolled 
huge amounts of dice. That greatly increased the consistency. (What I 
mean by this is that if you rolled a million dice, your chance of 
averaging 3.5 is much higher than if you rolled ten.) Players, though, 
equated lots of dice rolling with the game being "more random" even 
though that contradicts the actual math.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Mark Rosewater, <a href="https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/37" rel="nofollow">Kind Acts of Randomness</a></li></ul>

about the “realness” of language, nor does it often care about the exact

<blockquote><p>The categories and classes we construct are simply the 
semantic sugar which makes the reality go down easier. They should never
 get confused for the reality that is, the reality which we perceive but
 darkly and with biased lenses. The hyper-relativists and subjectivists 
who are moderately fashionable in some humane studies today are correct 
to point out that science is a human construction and endeavor. Where 
they go wrong is that they are often ignorant of the fact that the 
orderliness of many facets of nature is such that even human ignorance 
and stupidity can be overcome with adherence to particular methods and 
institutional checks and balances. The predictive power of modern 
science, giving rise to modern engineering, is the proof of its 
validity. No talk or argumentation is needed. Boot up your computer. 
Drive your car.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/05/reification-is-alright-by-me/" rel="nofollow">Razib Khan</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Not long ago a couple across the aisle from me in a Quiet
 Car talked all the way from New York City to Boston, after two people 
had asked them to stop. After each reproach they would lower their 
voices for a while, but like a grade-school cafeteria after the lunch 
monitor has yelled for silence, the volume crept inexorably up again. It
 was soft but incessant, and against the background silence, as 
maddening as a dripping faucet at 3 a.m. All the way to Boston I debated
 whether it was bothering me enough to say something. As we approached 
our destination a professorial-looking man who’d spoken to them twice 
got up, walked back and stood over them. He turned out to be quite tall.
 He told them that they’d been extremely inconsiderate, and he’d had a 
much harder time getting his work done because of them.</p><p>“Sir,” the girl said, “I really don’t think we were bothering anyone else.”</p><p>“No,” I said, “you were really annoying.”</p><p>“Yes,” said the woman behind them.</p><p>“See,”
 the man explained gently, “this is how it works. I’m the one person who
 says something. But for everyone like me, there’s a whole car full of 
people who feel the same way.”</p></blockquote><p>-- Tim Kreider, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/opinion/sunday/the-quiet-ones.html?pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow"><em>The Quiet Ones</em></a></p>

<blockquote><p>What does puzzle people – at least it used to puzzle me –
 is the fact that Christians regard faith… as a virtue. I used to ask 
how on Earth it can be a virtue – what is there moral or immoral about 
believing or not believing a set of statements? Obviously, I used to 
say, a sane man accepts or rejects any statement, not because he wants 
or does not want to, but because the evidence seems to him good or bad. 
If he were mistaken about the goodness or badness of the evidence, that 
would not mean he was a bad man, but only that he was not very clever. 
And if he thought the evidence bad but tried to force himself to believe
 in spite of it, that would be merely stupid…</p><p>What I did not see 
then – and a good many people do not see still – was this. I was 
assuming that if the human mind once accepts a thing as true it will 
automatically go on regarding it as true, until some real reason for 
reconsidering it turns up. In fact, I was assuming that the human mind 
is completely ruled by reason. But that is not so. For example, my 
reason is perfectly convinced by good evidence that anesthetics do not 
smother me and that properly trained surgeons do not start operating 
until I am unconscious. But that does not alter the fact that when they 
have me down on the table and clap their horrible mask over my face, a 
mere childish panic begins inside me. I start thinking I am going to 
choke, and I am afraid they will start cutting me up before I am 
properly under. In other words, I lose my faith in anesthetics. It is 
not reason that is taking away my faith; on the contrary, my faith is 
based on reason. It is my imagination and emotions. The battle is 
between faith and reason on one side and emotion and imagination on the 
other…</p><p>Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is 
the art of holding onto things your reason has once accepted, in spite 
of your changing moods. For moods will change, whatever view your reason
 takes. I know that by experience. Now that I am a Christian, I do have 
moods in which the whole thing looks very improbable; but when I was an 
atheist, I had moods in which Christianity looked terribly probable... 
Unless you teach your moods "where they get off" you can never be either
 a sound Christian or even a sound atheist, but just a creature 
dithering to and fro, with its beliefs really dependent on the weather 
and the state of its digestion. Consequently one must train the habit of
 faith.</p></blockquote><p>C. S. Lewis, <em>Mere Christianity</em></p><p>Caveat: this is <em>not at all</em>
 how the majority of the religious people that I know would use the word
 "faith". In fact, this passage turned out to be one of the earliest 
helps in bringing me to think critically about and ultimately discard my
 religious worldview.</p>

<blockquote><p>Two very different attitudes toward the technical workings
of mathematics are found in the literature. Already in 1761, Leonhard Euler complained about
isolated results which "are not based on a systematic method" and therefore whose "inner grounds
seem to be hidden." Yet in the 20'th Century, writers as diverse in viewpoint as Feller and de Finetti
are agreed in considering computation of a result by direct application of the systematic rules of
probability theory as dull and unimaginative, and revel in the finding of some isolated clever trick
by which one can see the answer to a problem without any calculation.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Feller's perception was so keen that in virtually every problem he was able to see a clever trick;
and then gave only the clever trick. So his readers get the impression that:</p><ul><li>Probability theory has no systematic methods; it is a collection of isolated, unrelated
clever tricks, each of which works on one problem but not on the next one.</li><li>Feller was possessed of superhuman cleverness.</li><li>Only a person with such cleverness can hope to find new useful results in probability
theory.</li></ul><p>Indeed, clever tricks do have an aesthetic quality that we all appreciate at once. But we doubt
whether Feller, or anyone else, was able to see those tricks on first looking at the problem.
We solve a problem for the first time by that (perhaps dull to some) direct calculation applying
our systematic rules. After seeing the solution, we may contemplate it and see a clever trick that
would have led us to the answer much more quickly. Then, of course, we have the opportunity
for gamesmanship by showing others only the clever trick, scorning to mention the base means by
which we first found.</p></blockquote><p>E. T. Jaynes "Probability Theory, The Logic of Science"</p>

  <p>I listen to all these complaints about rudeness and 
intemperateness, and the opinion that I come to is that there is no 
polite way of asking somebody: have you considered the possibility that 
your entire life has been devoted to a delusion? But that’s a good 
question to ask. Of course we should ask that question and of course 
it’s going to offend people. Tough.</p></blockquote>

  <p>The bulk of political discourse today is purposefully playing 
telephone with facts in ways that couldn't be done in the Information 
Age if people just had the know-how to check for themselves. 
Comprehending complex sentences is something that can be done by first 
grade, and comprehending complex concepts and issues is without a doubt 
something better learned in math than in English, where one learns to <em>obfuscate</em>
 concepts and issues, and to play to baser emotions. Granted, one also 
learns to recognize and to defend against these tactics, but it still 
can't hold a candle to the "mental gymnastics" referenced above. Do you 
realize what the world looks like if you've got a background in math? 
Imagine signs reading DANGER: KEEP OUT are planted everywhere, but 
people purposefully and proudly ignore them, treating it as laughably 
eccentric to have learned more than half the alphabet, approaching en 
masse and dragging you with them.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>British philosophy is more detailed and piecemeal than 
that of the Continent; when it allows itself some general principle, it 
sets to work to prove it inductively by examining its various 
applications. Thus Hume, after announcing that there is no idea without 
an antecedent impression, immediately proceeds to consider the following
 objection: suppose you are seeing two shades of colour which are 
similar but not identical, and suppose you have never seen a shade of 
colour intermediate between the two, can you nevertheless imagine such a
 shade? He does not decide the question, and considers that a decision 
adverse to his general principle would not be fatal to him, because his 
principle is not logical but empirical. When--to take a 
contrast--Leibniz wants to establish his monadology, he argues, roughly,
 as follows: Whatever is complex must be composed of simple parts; what 
is simple cannot be extended; therefore everything is composed of parts 
having no extension. But what is not extended is not matter. Therefore 
the ultimate constituents of things are not material, and, if not 
material, then mental. Consequently a table is really a colony of souls.</p><p>The
 difference of method, here, may be characterized as follows: In Locke 
or Hume, a comparatively modest conclusion is drawn from a broad survey 
of many facts, whereas in Leibniz a vast edifice of deduction is 
pyramided upon a pin-point of logical principle. In Leibniz, if the 
principle is completely true and the deductions are entirely valid, all 
is well; but the structure is unstable, and the slightest flaw anywhere 
brings it down in ruins. In Locke or Hume, on the contrary, the base of 
the pyramid is on the solid ground of observed fact, and the pyramid 
tapers upward, not downward; consequently the equilibrium is stable, and
 a flaw here or there can be rectified without total disaster.</p></blockquote><p>--Bertrand Russell, <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em></p>

<blockquote><p>In Japan, it is widely believed that you don't have

 presumptuous to assume otherwise), and so it is uncommon to describe 
other people's thoughts directly, such as "He likes ice cream" or "She's
 angry". Instead, it's far more common to see things like "I heard that

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing I have advocated, without much success, is that children 
be taught social rules (when they are ready) in exactly the same way 
they are taught and teach each other games. The point is not whether the
 rules are right or wrong. Are the rules of 5-card stud poker or 
hopscotch right or wrong? It's that we're playing a certain game here, 
and there are rules to this game just as in any other game. If you want 
to be in the game, then you have to learn how to play it. Different 
groups of people play different games (different rules = different 
game), so if you want to play in different groups, you have to learn the
 games they play. When you develop the levels of understanding above the
 rule level, you'll be able to understand all games, and be able to join
 in anywhere. You won't be stuck knowing how to play only one game.</p>
  
  <p>My problem with selling this idea is that people tend to think that
 their game is the only right one. In fact, being told that they are 
playing a game with arbitrary rules is insulting or frightening. They 
want to believe that the rules they know are the ones that everyone 
ought to play by; they even set up systems of punishment and reward to 
make sure that nobody tries to play a different game. They turn the game
 into something that is deadly serious, and so my idea simply seems 
frivolous instead of liberating.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>...beliefs are like clothes. In a harsh environment, we 
choose our clothes mainly to be functional, i.e., to keep us safe and

for their appearance, i.e., to show our figure, our creativity, and our 
allegiances. Similarly, when the stakes are high we may mainly want 
accurate beliefs to help us make good decisions. But when a belief has 
few direct personal consequences, we in effect mainly care about the 
image it helps to project.</p></blockquote><p>-Robin Hanson, <em>Human Enhancement</em></p>

<blockquote><p>A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are 
rarely stumped. True, you occasionally face a question such as 17 × 24 =
 ? to which no answer comes immediately to mind, but these dumbfounded 
moments are rare. The normal state of your mind is that you have 
intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your 
way. You like or dislike people long before you know much about them; 
you trust or distrust strangers without knowing why; you feel that an 
enterprise is bound to succeed without analyzing it. Whether you state 
them or not, you often have answers to questions that you do not 
completely understand, relying on evidence that you can neither explain 
nor defend.</p></blockquote><p>Daniel Kahneman,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364833033&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow" rel="nofollow">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></p>

<blockquote><p>When I was at Cornell, I often talked to the people in 
the psychology department. One of the students told me she wanted to do 
an experiment that went something like this -- it had been found by 
others that under certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A. She 
was curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they 
would still do A. So her proposal was to do the experiment under 
circumstances Y and see if they still did A.</p><p>I explained to her 
that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment 
of the other person -- to do it under condition X to see if she could 
also get result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she 
would know that the real difference was the thing she thought she had 
under control.</p><p>She was very delighted with this new idea, and went
 to her professor. And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because 
the experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time. This
 was in about 1947 or so, and it seems to have been the general policy 
then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change 
the conditions and see what happens. Nowadays there's a certain danger 
of the same thing happening, even in the famous field of physics. ...</p></blockquote><p>-- Richard Feynman's <em>Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.</p><p>My 
rule has to do with paradigm shifts—yes, I do believe in them. I've been
 through a few myself. It is useful if you want to be the first on your 
block to know that the shift has taken place. I formulated the rule in 
1974. I was visiting the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for a
 weeks to give a couple of seminars on particle physics. The subject was
 QCD. It doesn't matter what this stands for. The point is that it was a
 new theory of sub-nuclear particles and it was absolutely clear that it
 was the right theory. There was no critical experiment but the place 
was littered with smoking guns. Anyway, at the end of my first lecture I
 took a poll of the audience. "What probability would you assign to the 
proposition 'QCD is the right theory of hadrons.'?" My socks were 
knocked off by the answers. They ranged from .01 percent to 5 percent. 
As I said, by this time it was a clear no-brainer. The answer should 
have been close to 100 percent.
The next day I gave my second seminar and took another poll. "What are 
you working on?" was the question. Answers: QCD, QCD, QCD, QCD, 
QCD,........ Everyone was working on QCD. That's when I learned to ask 
"What are you doing?" instead of "what do you think?"</p><p>I saw 
exactly the same phenomenon more recently when I was working on black 
holes. This time it was after a string theory seminar, I think in Santa 
Barbara. I asked the audience to vote whether they agreed with me and 
Gerard 't Hooft or if they thought Hawking’s ideas were correct. This 
time I got a 50-50 response. By this time I knew what was going on so I 
wasn't so surprised. Anyway I later asked if anyone was working on 
Hawking's theory of information loss. Not a single hand went up. Don't 
ask what they think. Ask what they do.</p></blockquote><p>-Leonard Susskind, <a href="http://edge.org/response-detail/10417" rel="nofollow">Susskinds Rule of Thumb</a></p>

  <p>What is more important in determining an (individual) organism's phenotype, its genes or its environment?
  Any developmental biologist knows that this is a meaningless question. <em>Every aspect of an organism's phenotype is the joint product of its genes and its environment.</em>
 To ask which is more important is like asking, Which is more important 
in determining the area of a rectangle, the length or the width? Which 
is more important in causing a car to run, the engine or the gasoline? 
Genes <em>allow</em> the environment to influence the development of phenotypes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Another learning which cost me much to recognize, can be stated in four words. <em>The facts are friendly.</em></p><p>It
 has interested me a great deal that most psychotherapists, especially 
the psychoanalysts, have steadily refused to make any scientific 
investigation of their therapy, or to permit others to do this. I can 
understand this reaction because I have felt it. Especially in our early
 investigations I can well remember the anxiety of waiting to see how 
the findings came out. Suppose our hypotheses were disproved! Suppose we
 were mistaken in our views! Suppose our opinions were not justified! At
 such times, as I look back, it seems to me that I regarded the facts as
 potential enemies, as possible bearers of disaster. I have perhaps been
 slow in coming to realize that the facts are <em>always</em> friendly. 
Every bit of evidence one can acquire, in any area, leads one that much 
closer to what is true. And being closer to the truth can never be a 
harmful or dangerous or unsatisfying thing. So while I still hate to 
readjust my thinking, still hate to give up old ways of perceiving and 
conceptualizing, yet at some deeper level I have, to a considerable 
degree, come to realize that these painful reorganizations are what is 
known as <em>learning,</em> and that though painful they always lead to a
 more satisfying because somewhat more accurate way of seeing life. Thus
 at the present time one of the most enticing areas for thought and 
speculation is an area where several of my pet ideas have <em>not</em> 
been upheld by the evidence, I feel if I can only puzzle my way through 
this problem that I will find a much more satisfying approximation to 
the truth. I feel sure the facts will be my friends.</p></blockquote><p>-Carl Rogers, <em>On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View of Psychotherapy</em> (1961)</p>

<p>On the presentation of science in the news:</p><blockquote><p>It's 
not that clean energy will never happen -- it totally will. It's just 
that it won't come from a wild-haired scientist running out of his 
basement screaming, "Eureka! I've discovered how to get limitless clean 
energy from common seawater!" Instead, it will come from thousands of 
scientists publishing unreadable studies with titles like "Assessing 
Effectiveness and Costs of Asymmetrical Methods of Beryllium Containment
 in Gen 4 Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors When Factoring for Cromulence
 Decay." The world will be saved by a series of boring, incremental 
advances that chip away at those technical challenges one tedious step 
at a time.</p><p>But nobody wants to read about that in their morning 
Web browsing. We want to read that while we were sleeping, some unlikely
 hero saved the world. Or at least cured cancer.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-easy-ways-to-spot-b.s.-news-story-internet" rel="nofollow">David Wong — 5 Easy Ways to Spot a BS News Story on the Internet</a></p>

<blockquote><p>More specifically, one thing I learned from Terry that I 
was not taught in school is the importance of bad proofs. I would say "I
 think this is true", work on it, see that there was no nice proof, and 
give up. Terry would say "Here's a criterion that eliminates most of the
 problem. Then in what's left, here's a worse one that handles most of 
the detritus. One or two more epicycles. At that point it comes down to 
fourteen cases, and I checked them." Yuck. But we would know it was 
true, and we would move on. (Usually these would get cleaned up a fair

<blockquote>
  <p>'One day when I was a junior medical student, a very important 
Boston surgeon visited the school and delivered a great treatise on a 
large number of patients who had undergone successful operations for 
vascular reconstruction.</p>
  
  <p>At the end of the lecture, a young student at the back of the room 
timidly asked, “Do you have any controls?” Well, the great surgeon drew 
himself up to his full height, hit the desk, and said, “Do you mean did I
 not operate on half the patients?” The hall grew very quiet then. The 
voice at the back of the room very hesitantly replied, “Yes, that’s what
 I had in mind.” Then the visitor’s fist really came down as he 
thundered, “Of course not. That would have doomed half of them to their 
death.”</p>
  
  <p>God, it was quiet then, and one could scarcely hear the small voice ask, “Which half?”'</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we then call the original replicator molecules 'living'? Who
 cares? I might say to you 'Darwin was the greatest man who has ever 
lived', and you might say 'No, Newton was', but I hope we would not 
prolong the argument. The point is that no conclusion of substance would
 be affected whichever way our argument was resolved. The facts of the 
lives and achievements of Newton and Darwin remain totally unchanged 
whether we label them 'great' or not. Similarly, the story of the 
replicator molecules probably happened something like the way I am 
telling it, regardless of whether we choose to call them 'living'. Human
 suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that 
words are only tools for our use, and that the mere presence in the 
dictionary of a word like 'living' does not mean it necessarily has to 
refer to something definite in the real world. Whether we call the early
 replicators living or not, they were the ancestors of life; they were 
our founding fathers.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, there's another problem, and that is the fact that statistical
 and probabilistic thinking is a real damper on "intellectual" 
conversation. By this, I mean that there are many individuals who wish 
to make inferences about the world based on data which they observe, or 
offer up general typologies to frame a subsequent analysis. These 
individuals tend to be intelligent and have college degrees. Their 
discussion ranges over topics such as politics, culture and philosophy. 
But, introduction of questions about the moments about the distribution,
 or skepticism as to the representativeness of their sample, and so on, 
tends to have a chilling affect on the regular flow of discussion. While
 the average human being engages mostly in gossip and interpersonal 
conversation of some sort, the self-consciously intellectual interject a
 bit of data and abstraction (usually in the form of jargon or pithy 
quotations) into the mix. But the raison d'etre of the intellectual 
discussion is basically signaling and cuing; in other words, social 
display. No one really cares about the details and attempting to 
generate a rigorous model is really beside the point. Trying to push the
 N much beyond 2 or 3 (what you would see in a college essay format) 
will only elicit eye-rolling and irritation.</p></blockquote>

  <p>My friend, Tony, does prop work in Hollywood. Before he was big and
 famous, he would sell jewelry and such at Ren Faires and the like. One 
day I'm there, shooting the shit with him, when a guy comes up and looks
 at some of the crystals that Tony is selling. he finally zeroes in on 
one and gets all gaga over the bit of quartz. He informs Tony that he's 
never seen such a strong power crystal. Tony tells him it a piece of 
quartz. The buyer maintains it is an amazing power crystal and demands 
to know the price. Tony looks him over for a second, then says "If it's 
just a piece of quartz, it's $15. If it's a power crystal, it's $150. 
Which is is?"
  The buyer actually looked a bit sheepish as he said quietly "quartz", 
gave Tony his money and wandered off. I wonder if he thought he got the 
better of Tony.</p></blockquote>

<p>"What do you think the big headlines were in 1666, the year Newton 
posited gravitation as a universal force, discovered that white light 
was composed of the colors of the spectrum, and invented differential 
calculus, or in 1905, the “annus mirabilis” when Einstein confirmed 
quantum theory by analyzing the photoelectric effect, introduced special
 relativity, and proposed the formulation that matter and energy are 
equivalent? The Great Fire of London and the Anglo-Dutch War; The 
Russian Revolution and the Russo-Japanese War. The posturing and 
squabbling of politicians and the exchange of gunfire over issues that 
would be of little interest or significance to anyone alive now. In 
other words, ephemeral bullshit. These insights and discoveries are the 
real history of our species, the slow painstaking climb from ignorance 
to understanding."</p>

<p>Therefore, the first and most important duty of philosophy is to test
 impressions, choosing between them and only deploying those that have 
passed the test. You know how, with money--an area where we believe our 
interest to be at stake--we have developed the art of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay" rel="nofollow">assaying</a>,
 and considerable ingenuity has gone into developing a way to test if 
coins are counterfeit, involving our senses of sight, smell, hearing, 
and touch. The assayer will let the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius" rel="nofollow">denarius</a>
 drop and listen intently to its ring; and he is not satisfied to listen
 just once: after repeated listenings he practically acquires a 
musician's subtle ear. It is a measure of the effort we are prepared to 
expend to guard against deception when accuracy is at a premium.</p><p>When
 it comes to our poor mind, however, we can't be bothered; we are 
satisfied accepting any and all impressions, because here the loss we 
suffer is not obvious. If you want to know just how little concerned you
 are about things good and bad, and how serious about things 
indifferent, compare your attitude to going blind with your attitude 
about being mentally in the dark. You will realize, I think, how 
inappropriate your values really are.</p><p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epictetus/" rel="nofollow">Epictetus</a>, Discourses I.20.7-12 (pages 51-52 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discourses-Selected-Writings-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449469" rel="nofollow">this edition</a>) (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0235%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D20" rel="nofollow">original Greek</a>, with alternate translations at the link)</p><p>Edited to correct a typo.</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems that 32 Bostonians have simultaneously dropped

top-notch scientists and engineers won't even speculate about the color

<blockquote><p>By the middle of the seventeenth century it had come to 
be understood that the world was enclosed in a sea of air, much as the 
greater part of it was covered by water. A scientist of the period, 
Francesco Lana, contended that a lighter-than-air ship could float upon 
this sea, and he suggested how such a ship might be built. He was unable
 to put his invention to a practical test, but he saw only one reason 
why it might not work:</p><p>". . . that God will never suffer this 
Invention to take effect, because of the many consequencies which may 
disturb the Civil Government of men. For who sees not, that no City can 
be secure against attack, since our Ship may at any time be placed 
directly over it, and descending down may discharge Souldiers; the same 
would happen to private Houses, and Ships on the Sea: for our Ship 
descending out of the Air to the sails of Sea-Ships, it may cut their 
Ropes, yea without descending by casting Grapples it may over-set them, 
kill their men, burn their Ships by artificial Fire works and 
Fire-balls. And this they may do not only to Ships but to great 
Buildings, Castles, Cities, with such security that they which cast 
these things down from a height out of Gun-shot, cannot on the other 
side be offended by those below."</p><p>Lana's reservation was 
groundless. He had predicted modern air warfare in surprisingly accurate
 detail—with its paratroopers and its strafing and bombing. Contrary to 
his expectation, God has suffered his invention to take effect. And so 
has Man.</p></blockquote><ul><li>B. F. Skinner, "Science and Human Behavior"</li></ul>

<p>Or, as the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Don%27t+Hate+The+Playa/Playette+Hate+The+Game" rel="nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not fault the successful participant in a flawed system; try 
instead to discern and rebuke that aspect of its organization which 
allows or encourages the behavior that has provoked your displeasure.</p></blockquote>

<p>A meta-comment: It's always good to have an arsenal of 
mainstream-accessible quotes to use for those times when explaining game
 theory is just loo much of an inferential leap. I'd like to find more 
of these.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are big differences between "a study" and "a good

confirmed" and "a study that's been independently confirmed a dozen 
times over." These differences are important; when a scientist says 
something, it's not the same as the Pope saying it. It's only when

<p>How a game theorist buys a car:</p><blockquote><p>"Hello, my name is 
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita. I plan to buy the following car [list the exact
 model and features] today at five P.M. I am calling all of the 
dealerships within a fifty-mile radius of my home and I am telling each 
of them what I am telling you. I will come in and buy the car today at 
five P.M. from the dealer who gives me the lowest price. I need to have 
the all-in price, including taxes, dealer prep [I ask them not to prep 
the car and not charge me for it, since dealer prep is little more than 
giving you a washed car with plastic covers and paper floormats removed,
 usually for hundreds of dollars], everything, because I will make out 
the check to your dealership before I come and will not have another 
check with me."</p></blockquote><p>From <em>The Predictioneer's Game</em>, page 7.</p><p>Other car-buying tips from Bueno de Mesquita, in case you're about to buy a car: <br><br>
* Figure out exactly what car you want to buy by searching online before making any contact with dealerships. <br><br>
* Don't be afraid to purchase a car from a distant dealership--the manufacturer provides the warranty, not the dealer. <br><br>
* Be sure to tell each dealer you will be sharing the price they quote you with subsequent dealers. <br><br>
* Don't take shit from dealers who tell you "you can't buy a car over 
the phone" or do anything other than give you their number. If a dealer 
is stonewalling, make it quite clear that you're willing to get what you
 want elsewhere. <br><br>
* Arrive at the lowest-price dealer just before 5:00 PM to close the 
deal. In the unlikely event that the dealer changes their terms, go for 
the next best price.</p>

<blockquote><p>For the Greek philosophers, Greek was the language of 
reason. Aristotle's list of categories is squarely based on the 
categories of Greek grammar. This did not explicitly entail a claim that
 the Greek language was primary: it was simply a case of the 
identification of thought with its natural vehicle. <em>Logos</em> was thought, and <em>Logos</em>
 was speech. About the speech of barbarians little was known; hence, 
little was known about what it would be like to think in the language of
 barbarians. Although the Greeks were willing to admit that the 
Egyptians, for example, possessed a rich and venerable store of wisdom, 
they only knew this because someone had explained it to them in Greek.</p></blockquote><p>— Umberto Eco, <em>The Search for the Perfect Language</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Is time real? …In one sense, it’s a silly question. The

part of a useful vocabulary we have for describing the world, talking 
about “reality” is just a bit of harmless gassing. They may be emergent

<p>A young boy walks into a barber shop and the barber whispers to his 
customer, “This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it 
to you.” The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in 
the other, then calls the boy over and asks, “Which do you want, son?” 
The boy takes the quarters and leaves. “What did I tell you?” said the 
barber. “That kid never learns!” Later, when the customer leaves, he 
sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. “Hey, son! 
May I ask you a question? Why did you take the quarters instead of the 
dollar bill?” The boy licked his cone and replied, “Because the day I 
take the dollar, the game is over!”</p>

  <p>"At one of our dinners, Milton recalled traveling to an Asian 
country in the 1960s and visiting a worksite where a new canal was being
 built. He was shocked to see that, instead of modern tractors and earth
 movers, the workers had shovels. He asked why there were so few 
machines. The government bureaucrat explained: “You don’t understand. 
This is a jobs program.” To which Milton replied: “Oh, I thought you 
were trying to build a canal. If it’s jobs you want, then you should 
give these workers spoons, not shovels.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Disobedi-Ant</p><p>The story of the Disobedi-Ant is 
very short. It refused to believe that its powerful impulses to play 
instead of work were anything but unique expressions of its very unique 
self, and it went its merry way, singing, "What I choose to do has 
nothing to do with what any-ant else chooses to do! What could be more 
self-evident?"</p><p>Coincidentally enough, so went the reasoning of all
 its colony-mates. In fact, the same refrain was independently invented 
by every last ant in the colony, and each ant thought it original. It 
echoed throughout the colony, even with the same melody.</p><p>The colony perished.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/1985-hofstadter" rel="nofollow">Douglas Hofstadter</a> (posted with gwern's "permission")</p>

<blockquote><p>Among a great many other things that chess teaches you is
 to control the initial excitement you feel when you see something that 
looks good. It trains you to think before grabbing, and to think just as
 objectively when you're in trouble. When you're making a film you have 
to make most of your decisions on the run, and there is a tendency to 
always shoot from the hip. It takes more discipline than you might 
imagine, to think, even for thirty seconds, in the noisy, confusing, 
high-pressure atmosphere of a film set. But a few seconds' thought can 
often prevent a serious mistake being made about something that looks 
good at first glance. With respect to films, chess is more useful in 
preventing you from making mistakes than giving you ideas. Ideas come 
spontaneously and the discipline required to evaluate and put them to 
use tends to be the real work.</p></blockquote><p>-Stanley Kubrick</p>

<blockquote><p>Once there was a miser, who to save money would eat 
nothing but oatmeal. And what's more, he would make a great big batch of
 it at the start of every week, and put it in a drawer, and when he 
wanted a meal he would slice off a piece and eat it cold; thus he saved 
on firewood. Now, by the end of the week, the oatmeal would be somewhat 
moldy and not very appetising; and so to make himself eat it, the miser 
would take out a bottle of good whiskey, and pour himself a glass, and 
say "All right, Olai, eat your oatmeal and when you're done, you can 
have a dram." Then he would eat his moldy oatmeal, and when he was done 
he'd laugh and pour the whiskey back in the bottle, and say "Hah! And 
you believed that? There's one born every minute, to be sure!" And thus 
he had a great savings in whiskey as well.</p></blockquote><p>-- Norwegian folktale.</p>

<p>During the discussion of Pranknet on Slashdot about a month ago, I saw <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1330685&amp;no_d2=1&amp;cid=29006063" rel="nofollow">this comment</a>.  It reminded me of our discussions about Newcomb's problem and superrationality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I also disagree that our society is based on mutual trust. 
Volumes and volumes of laws backed up by lawyers, police, and jails show
 otherwise.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>That's called selection/observation bias. You're looking at only one side of the coin.</p>
  
  <p>I've lived in countries where there's a <em>lot</em> less trust 
than here. The notion of returning an opened product to a store and 
getting a full refund is based on trust (yes, there's a profit 
incentive, and some people do screw the retailers [and the retailers 
their customers -- SB], but the system works overall). In some countries
 I've been to, this would be unfeasible: Almost everyone will try to 
exploit such a retailer.</p>
  
  <p>When a storm knocks out the electricity and the traffic lights stop
 working, I've always seen everyone obeying the rules. I doubt it's 
because they're worried about cops. It's about trust that the other 
drivers will do likewise. Simply unworkable in other places I've lived 
in.</p>
  
  <p>I've had neighbors whom I don't know receive UPS/FedEx packages for
 me. Again, trust. I don't think they're afraid of me beating them up.</p>
  
  <p>There are loads of examples. Society, at least in the US, is fairly nice and a lot of that has to do with a common trust.</p>
  
  <p>Which is why someone exploiting that trust is a despised person.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, because to be treated as a boy was to be taken on the old

<p><a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/arithmetic.html" rel="nofollow">He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense.</a></p>

<p>-John McCarthy, on mainstream environmentalism.</p>

<p>As someone who regularly gets into arguments about this, I can say 
that he's definitely right; you wouldn't believe the amount of nonsense 
that can be disposed of simply by looking up the relevant numbers and 
doing a minute's worth of easy arithmetic.</p>

<p>For example, I've heard some people recently claiming that a 
combination of solar photovoltaics, electrolysis to produce hydrogen, 
and these new Bloom box fuel cells are cheaper than nuclear fission. 
Look up the costs of solar farms; about $3 per peak watt. Their average 
power output is less; we can very optimistically assume that they run at
 20% of capacity on average. Efficiency losses from electrolysis and 
fuel cells are about 50%. Putting it all together, this would cost about
 $30 per watt of average power delivered. Not including the cost of the 
fuel cells.</p>

<p>A little googling will show that the total cost of building two new 
AP1000 reactors in Georgia is about $14 billion, and they average at 
least 93% of their peak power, and transmission line losses bring their 
average power delivered to about 1000 MW each. So their cost is about $7
 per watt of average power delivered, or about 23% the cost of solar.</p>

<p>There's a lot of extremely harmful bullshit out there, and defeating 
most of it doesn't take any advanced techniques; it just takes a 
willingness to look up some relevant numbers and do a bit of arithmetic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes, apparently rational self-interested strategies turn out 
(as in the prisoners' dilemma) to be self-defeating. This may look like a
 defeat for rationality, but it is not. Rationality is saved by its own 
open-endedness. If a strategy of following accepted rules of rationality
 is sometimes self-defeating, this is not the end. We revise the rules 
to take account of this, so producing a higher-order rationality 
strategy. This in turn may fail, but again we go up a level. At whatever
 level we fail, there is always the process of standing back and going 
up a further level.</p></blockquote>

respectably recommended, by men too in high places, and is designed for a
 calculator, to save the trouble of all mathematical labor. By turning 
the machinery it produces correct results in addition, substraction, 
multiplication, and division, and the operator assured us that it was 
equally useful in fractions and the higher mathematics." The Editor 
thinks that such machines, by which the scholar may, by turning a crank,
 grind out the solution of a problem without the fatigue of mental 
application, would by its introduction into schools, do incalculable 
injury, But who knows that such machines when brought to greater 
perfection, may not think of a plan to remedy all their own defects and 
then grind out ideas beyond the ken of mortal mind!"

<blockquote>
  <p>One day, I was playing with an "express wagon," a little wagon with
 a railing around it, I noticed something about the way the ball moved. 
 I went to my father and said, "Say, Pop, I noticed something.  When I 
pull the wagon, the ball rolls to the back of the wagon.  And when I'm 
pulling it along and I suddenly stop, the ball rolls to the front of the
 wagon. Why is that?"</p>
  
  <p>"That, nobody knows," he said.  "The general principle is that 
things which are moving tend to keep on moving, and things which are 
standing still tend to stand still, unless you push them hard.  This 
tendency is called 'inertia,' but nobody knows why it's true."  Now, 
that's a deep understanding.  He didn't just give me the name.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is 
that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it
 implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most 
successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own 
love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own 
motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more 
today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of
 others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.</p></blockquote><p>-- Neil DeGrasse Tyson</p>

<blockquote><p>So, let's say some bros of mine and I have some 
hand-signals for, you know, bro stuff. And one of the signals means, 
"Oh, shit. Here comes that girl! You know. That girl. She's coming." 
That signal has a particular context. Eventually, one of my bros gets 
tired of sloppy use of the signal, and sets about laying out 
specifically what situations make a girl that girl. If I used the signal
 in a close-but-not-quite context, he'd handle it and then pull me aside
 and say, "I know she and I had that thing that one time, but we 
never... well, it wasn't quite THAT. You know? So that signal, it 
freaked me out, because I thought it had to be someone else. Make sure 
you're using it properly, okay?" And I'd be like, "Bro. Got it."</p><p>Another
 friend of mine, he recognizes the sorts of situations we use the signal
 in have a common thread, so he begins using the hand signal for other 
situations, any situation that has the potential for both danger and 
excitement. So if someone invites us to this real sketchy bar, he'll 
give me the signal - "This could be bad. But what if it's not?" And I'd 
respond, "I see what you did there."</p><p>Maybe you see where this is 
going. We're hanging out one day, and some guy suggests we crash some 
party. Bro #2 signals, and bro #1 freaks out, looking around. And then 
he's like, "OH FUCK I HAVE TO CALL HER." And #2 says, "No, dude, there's
 no one coming. I just meant, this is like one of those situations, you 
know?" And they're pissed at each other because they're using the same 
signal to mean different things. I'm not mad, because I generally know 
what they each mean, but I have more context than they do.</p><p>The same thing probably happens with analytics and Continentals.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.philosophybro.com/2011/12/mailbag-monday-analytic-and-continental.html" rel="nofollow">Philosophy Bro</a></p>

<blockquote><p>My experience as a marriage counselor taught me that for a
 discussion of a disagreement to be productive, the parties have to have
 a shared understanding of what is being debated. If a husband thinks a 
marital debate is about leaving the toliet seat up or not, and the wife 
thinks it is about why her husband never listens to, appreciates or 
loves her the way he should, expect fireworks and frustration. If you 
are in an argument that you think is about government debt and it’s 
going nowhere, it may be because the person you are debating isn’t 
really arguing about the current level of government debt. Rather, they 
are arguing about the size of government.</p><p>If you get into a debate
 that is ostensibly about the level of government debt, try the 
following tactic (or try it on yourself in your own mind): If your 
opponent says that government debt is too high and we therefore need to 
cut public spending, ask whether s/he has EVER favored under ANY 
economic conditions a nice, fat increase in public spending. If you are 
debating someone who says that government debt is no big deal and that 
we should be increasing public spending, ask if s/he has EVER favored 
under ANY economics conditions a big, fat cut in public spending. You 
are going to get a no answer most of the time; maybe almost all the 
time.</p><p>…Is that wrong? No, it’s just frustrating when you are 
arguing about one thing and the other person is arguing about something 
else (or, when BOTH of you are actually arguing about something other 
than what on the face of it you think you are arguing about). The 
solution?: Drop the charade and get down to business. How big government
 should be is an essential political argument for the members of a 
society to have, so why not just have it up front?</p></blockquote><p>--<a href="http://www.samefacts.com/2013/07/public-management/why-debates-about-public-debt-are-often-unproductive/" rel="nofollow">Keith Humphreys</a></p><p>(I

politics discussion! I think these kind of proxy arguments are a very

  <p>RS: Butt-Head, I have a question for you. I noticed that you often 
say, "I like stuff that's cool." But isn't that circular logic? I mean, 
what is the definition of "cool," other than an adjective denoting 
something the speaker likes?</p>
  
  <p>BH: Huh-huh. Uh, did you, like, go to college?</p>
  
  <p>RS: You don't have to go to college to know the definition of 
"redundant." What I'm saying is that essentially what you're saying is 
"I like stuff that I like."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Economists essentially have a sophisticated lack of understanding 
of economics, especially macroeconomics. I know it sounds ridiculous. 
But the reason why I tell people they should study economics is not so 
they’ll know something at the end—because I don’t think we know much—but
 because we’re good at thinking. Economics teaches you to think things 
through. What you see a lot of times in economics is disdain for other's
 lack of thinking. You have to think about the ramifications of policies
 in the short run, the medium run, and the long run. Economists think 
they’re good at doing that, but they’re good at doing that in the sense 
that they can write down a model that will help them think about it—not 
in terms of empirically knowing what the answers are. And we have gotten
 so enamored of thinking things through that the fact that we don’t know
 anything needs to bother us more. So, yes, it’s true that the average 
guy on the street doesn’t understand economics, and it’s also true that 
we don’t understand economics. We just have a more sophisticated lack of
 understanding than the guy on the street.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It is the most common way of trying to cope with novelty:
 by means of metaphors and analogies we try to link the new to the old, 
the novel to the familiar. Under sufficiently slow and gradual change, 
it works reasonably well; in the case of a sharp discontinuity, however,
 the method breaks down: though we may glorify it with the name 'common 
sense', our past experience is no longer relevant, the analogies become 
too shallow, and the metaphors become more misleading than illuminating.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7EEWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html" rel="nofollow">E. W. Dijkstra</a></p>

<blockquote><p>There is one very valid test by which we may separate 
genuine, if perverse and unbalanced, originality and revolt from mere 
impudent innovation and bluff. The man who really thinks he has an idea 
will always try to explain that idea. The charlatan who has no idea will
 always confine himself to explaining that it is much too subtle to be 
explained. The first idea may be really outree or specialist; it may be 
really difficult to express to ordinary people. But because the man is 
trying to express it, it is most probable that there is something in it,
 after all. The honest man is he who is always trying to utter the 
unutterable, to describe the indescribable; but the quack lives not by 
plunging into mystery, but by refusing to come out of it.</p></blockquote><p>G K Chesterton</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was young, I thought the act of getting older meant, year by
 year, getting more sophisticated, more hard, cool, and unpitying. Less 
innocent.</p>
  
  <p>Maybe that was a childish idea of what getting older was about. 
Maybe adults, mature adults, get more innocent with time, not less. 
Because the word "innocent" does not mean "naive," it means "not 
guilty."</p>
  
  <p>Children do small evils to each other, schoolyard fights and 
insults, not because their hearts are pure, but because their powers are
 small. Grown-ups have more power. Some of them do great evils with that
 power. But what about the ones who don't? Aren't they more innocent 
than children, not less?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the wake of such suffering, there is no way to adequately 
explain the tragedy. Yet the seemingly random nature of the mass deaths 
has made them even harder for the survivors to understand.</p>
  
  <p>"In a situation like this, it's only natural to want to assign 
blame," said Dr. Frederick MacDougal of the National Center for 
Infectious Diseases, who recently lost a third cousin to a degenerative 
nerve disorder. "But the disturbing thing about this case is that no one
 factor is at fault. People are dying for such a wide range of 
reasons--gunshot wounds, black-lung disease, falls down elevator 
shafts--that we have been unable to isolate any single element as the 
cause."</p>
  
  <p>"No one simple explanation can encompass the enormous scope of this
 problem," MacDougal added. "And that's very difficult for most people 
to process psychologically."</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile, as the world continues to grapple with this seemingly 
unstoppable threat, the deaths--and the sorrow, fear and pain they have 
wrought--continue.</p>
  
  <p>As Margaret Heller, a volunteer at a clinic in Baltimore put it, 
"We do everything we can. But for most of the people we try to help, the
 sad truth is it's only a matter of time."</p></blockquote>

  <p>Education is a technology that tries to make up for what the human 
mind is innately bad at. Children don't have to go to school to learn 
how to walk, talk, recognize objects, or remember the personalities of 
their friends, even though these tasks are much harder than reading, 
adding, or remembering dates in history. They do have to go to school to
 learn written language, arithmetic, and science, because those bodies 
of knowledge and skill were invented too recently for any species-wide 
knack for them to have evolved.</p></blockquote>

  <p>News flash, dearies: there’s lots of areas of life that aren’t 
‘science’ where people do tend to get a mite hung up on particulars of 
what is and is not, in fact, true. Like in bookkeeping. Like in criminal
 investigations. Like when they’re trying to establish where their 
spouse was last night.</p>
  
  <p>Like, in fact, in most facets of life, hundreds of times a day, 
even if accounting isn’t your field and you’re not the accused at a 
criminal trial, and you’re not even married. Getting the facts right 
isn’t a concern of ‘science’, specifically. It’s a general concern of 
human beings. Getting reality right is, frequently, indeed, rather 
important if you wish to stay alive. It’s not a particularly academic 
question whether the car is or is not coming, when you cross the road. 
It’s the sort of thing one likes to get right. And we don’t generally 
call this ‘science’, either. We call it ‘looking’.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Here is a hand. How do I know? Look closely, asshole, it's clearly a hand.</p><p>Look,
 if you really insist on doubting that here is a hand, or anything else,
 there's nothing really I can say to convince you otherwise. What the 
tits would the world even look like if this weren't a hand? What sort of
 system is your doubt endorsing? After all, you can't just say "It's not
 true that here is a hand." You have to be endorsing some other picture 
of the world. [...]</p><p>So it turns out when I say things like "Here 
is a hand" I'm not really making a claim about the world, I'm laying 
down some rules for discussion. If you doubt there's a hand here, then 
fuck you and that's all there is to it. We can't really talk about 
anything now, because we can't even agree on something as simple as a 
goddamn hand. When we all agree here is a hand, then we can go about 
discussing our world in meaningful ways. Skepticism just undermines a 
foundation and replaces it with nothing; it[']s paralyzing. The grounds 
for such radical skepticism don't exist; it presupposes and relies on 
the very certainty it tries to undermine.</p><p>This is more practical 
than you realize. There are people who actually believe that the world 
is only 6,000 years old. What the fuck, right? But if you've ever talked
 with one of them, you know that they're fucking impossible to have what
 you consider a 'reasonable' discussion with. It's not like they don't 
have answers for everything, it[']s just that those answers don't make 
any fucking sense to you. It[']s the sort of gibberish that makes you 
want to scream. The problem is that you don't even play the game by the 
same goddamn rules. You're both certain of your positions, because those
 positions are logically derived from the worldview each of you endorses
 as your starting point, and you both look at each other's foundations 
and say, "Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about?" You don't 
even know how you would go about convincing them that you're right and 
they're wrong; you don't even agree on a method by which to do that.</p><p>If
 you flew to some part of the world where they'd never heard of an 
airplane or even a bird, how the fuck could you convince them you flew? 
They don't even know what that means. They would have all sorts of 
questions, and would consider your answers nonsensical or magical. When a
 non-believer is told that God exists, he reacts in the same way; also, a
 believer when he is told there is no God.</p><p>So everything we 
believe about the world is built on some sort of foundation. Sure, that 
foundation can change, but there is always something there at the base, 
and it is that base that enables us to talk about the world. Not 
everyone has the same base you do, and that has to be okay. Just know 
that some of your beliefs are just as unsupported as everyone else's. 
It's just the way it is, bro.</p></blockquote><p>— <a href="http://www.philosophybro.com/2011/01/wittgensteins-on-certainty-summary.html" rel="nofollow">Philosophy Bro summarizing Wittgensteins On Certainty</a>.

<p>Yes -- and to me, that's a perfect illustration of why experiments 
are relevant in the first place! More often than not, the only reason we
 need experiments is that we're not smart enough. After the experiment 
has been done, if we've learned anything worth knowing at all, then 
hopefully we've learned why the experiment wasn't necessary to begin 
with -- why it wouldn't have made sense for the world to be any other 
way. But we're too dumb to figure it out ourselves! --<a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html" rel="nofollow">Scott Aaronson</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Nor of course must they ever be allowed to raise

 that democracies like or the behaviour that will preserve a democracy. 
For if they did, it could hardly fail to occur to them that these need 
not be the same.</p><p>(..)</p><p>Even if they don’t read Aristotle 
(that would be undemocratic) you would have thought the French 
Revolution would have taught them that the behaviour aristocrats 
naturally like is not the behaviour that preserves aristocracy. They 
might then have applied the same principle to all forms of government.</p></blockquote><p>-- Screwtape, from "<a href="http://screwtapeblogs.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/screwtape-proposes-a-toast/" rel="nofollow">Screwtape Proposes a Toast</a>" by C. S. Lewis.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are those among us - among you, too, I observe - 
who glorify the wonders of the natural world with a kind of glassy-eyed 
fanaticism and urge a return to that purer, more innocent state. This 
testifies to nothing other than the fact that those who recommend the 
satisfactions of living in harmony with nature have never had to do it. 
Nature is evil. Nature is conflict, violence, betrayal; worms that crawl
 through the skin and breed in the gut; thorns that poison; snakes that 
fight in writhing, heaving masses until all lie dead from one another's 
poison. From nature we learned to tear the flesh off the bone and suck 
out the blood - and to enjoy it. Do you want to return to that state? I 
do not. <br><br>
... <br><br>
I have known Nature. I have known Civilization. Civilization is better.</p></blockquote><p>-- Donna Ball (writing as Donna Boyd), <em>The Passion</em></p>

<p>Just saw on reddit a <em>perfect</em> accidental metaphor: jakeredfield <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/feogz/i_need_to_share_my_friends_experience_with_portal/" rel="nofollow">posted this</a> in r/gaming:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the people that have no played Portal yet, be warned, there may be spoilers up ahead for you.</p>
  
  <p>So anyway, I am a huge fan of Portal, I love everything about the 
game. I bought it upon release and have played through it multiple 
times. My friends aren't as big of gamers as me so it took them some 
time to get their hands on Portal. My one friend didn't have a computer 
capable of running Portal so I let him play on mine.</p>
  
  <p>I pulled up a chair besides him and eagerly watched him play then 
entire time. He loved the game. I expected him to. It's an awesome game.
 But here comes the WTF part...(SPOILERS AHEAD)</p>
  
  <p>He go to the part at the last puzzle, right before GlaDOS tries to 
kill you in the fire. So then, my friend is like, "Oh, so it's one of 
those games where you die at the end. Haha, it was a good game." And 
then he immediately shuts it down. I just sat there. Shocked. In awe. I 
couldn't believe what I just saw. He turns to me and goes, "Good game, 
I'd play that again."</p>
  
  <p>This is the part where I just hit him and yell, "IT WASN'T OVER 
YET!" He was so confused. He loaded it back up to that part and couldn't
 figure it out. I then pointed it out to him what he needed to do from 
there. He eventually fully finished the game.</p>
  
  <p>Imagine what would have happened if I wasn't there? How many other 
people do you think only experienced the game up to this part, because 
they didn't have someone tell them?</p></blockquote>

<p>What makes it even more perfect is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/feogz/i_need_to_share_my_friends_experience_with_portal/c1fcwfa" rel="nofollow">this reply</a> by Aleitheo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So rather than try to see if he could live or even just die in the fire he turned off the game before he even saw the "ending"?</p></blockquote>

<p>T-Rex: If I lived in the past I'd have different beliefs, because I'd have nobody modern around to teach me anything else!</p>

<p>FACT.</p>

<p>And I find it really unlikely that I would come up with all our 
modern good stuff on my own, running around saying "You guys! Democracy 
is pretty okay. Also, women are equal to men, and racism? Kind of a dick
 move." If I was raised by racist and sexist parents in the middle of a 
racist and sexist society, I'm pretty certain I'd be racist and sexist! 
I'm only as enlightened as I am today because I've stood on the 
shoulders of giants.</p>

<p>Right. So that raises the question: Is everyone from that period in Hell, or is Heaven overwhelmingly populated by racists?</p>

<blockquote><p>Often a person uses some folk proverb to explain a 
behavioral event even though, on an earlier occasion, this same person 
used a directly contradictory folk proverb to explain the same type of 
event. For example, most of us have heard or said, “look before you 
leap.” Now there’s a useful, straightforward bit of behavioral 
advice—except that I vaguely remember admonishing on occasion, “he who 
hesitates is lost.” And “absence makes the heart grow fonder” is a 
pretty clear prediction of an emotional reaction to environmental 
events. But then what about “out of sight, out of mind”? And if “haste 
makes waste,” why do we sometimes hear that “time waits for no man”? How
 could the saying “two heads are better than one” not be true? Except 
that “too many cooks spoil the broth.” If I think “it’s better to be 
safe than sorry,” why do I also believe “nothing ventured, nothing 
gained”? And if “opposites attract,” why do “birds of a feather flock 
together”? I have counseled many students to “never to put off until 
tomorrow what you can do today.” But I hope my last advisee has never 
heard me say this, because I just told him, “cross that bridge when you 
come to it.”</p><p>The enormous appeal of clichés like these is that, 
taken together as implicit “explanations” of behavior, they cannot be 
refuted. No matter what happens, one of these explanations will be cited
 to cover it. No wonder we all think we are such excellent judges of 
human behavior and personality. We have an explanation for anything and 
everything that happens. Folk wisdom is cowardly in the sense that it 
takes no risk that it might be refuted.</p></blockquote><p>Keith E. Stanovich, <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205914128.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>How to Think Straight About Psychology</em>, 10th ed. (2013), 14.</a></p><p>ETA: Should have included the subsequent paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>That
 folk wisdom is “after the fact” wisdom, and that it actually is useless
 in a truly predictive sense, is why sociologist Duncan Watts titled one
 of his books: <em>Everything Is Obvious—Once You Know the Answer</em> 
(2011). Watts discusses a classic paper by Lazarsfeld (1949) in which, 
over 60 years ago, he was dealing with the common criticism that “social
 science doesn’t tell us anything that we don’t already know.” 
Lazarsfeld listed a series of findings from a massive survey of 600,000 
soldiers who had served during World War II; for example, that men from 
rural backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of service 
than soldiers from city backgrounds. People tend to find all of the 
survey results to be pretty obvious. In this example, for instance, 
people tend to think it obvious that rural men would have been used to 
harsher physical conditions and thus would have adapted better to the 
conditions of military life. It is likewise with all of the other 
findings—people find them pretty obvious. Lazarsfeld then reveals his 
punchline: All of the findings were the opposite of what was originally 
stated. For example, it was <em>actually</em> the case that men from 
city backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of service 
than soldiers from rural backgrounds. The last part of the learning 
exercise is for people to realize how easily they would have explained 
just the opposite finding. In the case of the actual outcome, people 
tend to explain it (when told of it first) by saying that they expected 
it because city men are used to working in crowded conditions and under 
hierarchical authority. They never realize how easily they would have 
concocted an explanation for exactly the opposite finding.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[S]econd thoughts tend to be tentative, and people tend 
not to believe that they are being lied to. Their own fairmindedness 
makes them gullible. Upon hearing two versions of any story, the natural
 reaction of any casual listener is to assume both versions are slanted 
to favor their side, and that the truth is perhaps somewhere in the 
middle. So if I falsely accuse an innocent group of ten people of 
wrongdoing, the average bystander, if he later hears my false accusation
 disputed, will assume that five or six of the people are guilty, rather
 than assume I lied and admit that he was deceived.</p></blockquote><p>-- <a href="http://www.scifiwright.com/2013/02/accuracy-in-media/" rel="nofollow">John C Wright</a></p>

 movie “Apollo 13″ does a fair job of showing how rapidly the engineers 
in Houston devised the kludge and documented it, but because of time 
contraints of course they can’t show you everything. NASA is a stickler 
for details. (Believe me, I’ve worked with them!) They don’t just rapid 
prototype something that people’s lives will depend upon. Overnight, 
they not only devised the scrubber adapter built from stuff in the 
launch manifest, they also tested it, documented it, and sent up 
stepwise instructions for constructing it. In a high-maturity 
organization, once you get into the habit of doing that, it doesn’t 
really take that long. Something that always puzzles me when I meet 
cowboy engineers who insist that process will just slow them down 
unacceptably. I tell them that hey, if NASA engineers could design, 
build, test, and document a CO2 scrubber adapter made from common 
household items <em>overnight</em>, you can damn well put in a comment when you check in your code changes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I discovered as a child that the user interface for 
reprogramming my own brain is my imagination. For example, if I want to 
reprogram myself to be in a happy mood, I imagine succeeding at a 
difficult challenge, or flying under my own power, or perhaps being able
 to levitate objects with my mind. If I want to perform better at a 
specific task, such as tennis, I imagine the perfect strokes before 
going on court. If I want to fall asleep, I imagine myself in pleasant 
situations that are unrelated to whatever is going on with my real life.</p><p>My
 most useful mental trick involves imagining myself to be far more 
capable than I am. I do this to reduce the risk that I turn down an 
opportunity just because I am clearly unqualified[...] As my career with
 Dilbert took off, reporters asked me if I ever imagined I would reach 
this level of success. The question embarrasses me because the truth is 
that I imagined a far greater level of success. That's my process. I 
imagine big.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/?EntryID=514" rel="nofollow">Scott Adams</a></p>

<blockquote><p>When I was a young untenured professor of philosophy, I 
once received a visit from a colleague from the Comparative Literature 
Department, an eminent and fashionable literary theorist, who wanted 
some help from me. I was flattered to be asked, and did my best to 
oblige, but the drift of his questions about various philosophical 
topics was strangely perplexing to me. For quite a while we were getting
 nowhere, until finally he managed to make clear to me what he had come 
for. He wanted "an epistemology," he said. An epistemology. Every 
self-respecting literary theorist had to sport an epistemology that 
season, it seems, and without one he felt naked, so he had come to me 
for an epistemology to wear--it was the very next fashion, he was sure, 
and he wanted the dernier cri in epistemologies. It didn't matter to him
 that it be sound, or defensible, or (as one might as well say) true; it
 just had to be new and different and stylish. Accessorize, my good 
fellow, or be overlooked at the party.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Daniel Dennett</li></ul><p>Example

  <p>The mere fact that it is possible to frame a question does not make
 it legitimate or sensible to do so. There are many things about which 
you can ask, "What is its temperature?" or "What color is it?" but you 
may not ask the temperature question or the color question of, say, 
jealousy or prayer. Similarly, you are right to ask the "Why" question 
of a bicycle's mudguards or the Kariba Dam, but at the very least you 
have no right to assume that the "Why" question deserves an answer when 
posed about a boulder, a misfortune, Mt. Everest, or the universe. 
Questions can be simply inappropriate, however heartfelt their framing.</p></blockquote>

<p>A fable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Persia many centuries ago, the Sufi mullah or holy man Nasruddin
 was arrested after preaching in the great square in front of the Shah's
 palace. The local clerics had objected to Mullah Nasruddin's unorthodox
 teachings, and had demanded his arrest and execution as a heretic. 
Dragged by palace guards to the Shah's throne room, he was sentenced 
immediately to death.</p>
  
  <p>As he was being taken away, however, Nasruddin cried out to the 
Shah: "O great Shah, if you spare me, I promise that within a year I 
will teach your favourite horse to sing!"</p>
  
  <p>The Shah knew that Sufis often told the most outrageous fables, 
which sounded blasphemous to many Muslims but which were nevertheless 
intended as lessons to those who would learn. Thus he had been tempted 
to be merciful, anyway, despite the demands of his own religious 
advisors. Now, admiring the audacity of the old man, and being a gambler
 at heart, he accepted his proposal.</p>
  
  <p>The next morning, Nasruddin was in the royal stable, singing hymns 
to the Shah's horse, a magnificent white stallion. The animal, however, 
was more interested in his oats and hay, and ignored him. The grooms and
 stablehands all shook their heads and laughed at him. "You old fool", 
said one. "What have you accomplished by promising to teach the Shah's 
horse to sing? You are bound to fail, and when you do, the Shah will not
 only have you killed - you'll be tortured as well, for mocking him!"</p>
  
  <p>Nasruddin turned to the groom and replied: "On the contrary, I have
 indeed accomplished much. Remember, I have been granted another year of
 life, which is precious in itself. Furthermore, in that time, many 
things can happen. I might escape. Or I might die anyway. Or the Shah 
might die, and his successor will likely release all prisoners to 
celebrate his accession to the throne".</p>
  
  <p>"Or...". Suddenly, Nasruddin smiled. "Or, perhaps, the horse will learn to sing".</p></blockquote>

<p>The original source of this fable seems to be lost to time. This version was written by <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Idries_Shah" rel="nofollow">Idries Shah</a>.</p>

more pleasing, more psychologically easy. I can't help it! OK! If I'm 
going to tell you honestly what the world looks like to the human beings
 who have struggled as hard as they can to understand it, I can only 
tell you what it looks like. And I cannot make it any simpler, I'm not 
going to do this, I'm not going to simplify it, and I'm not going to 
fake it. I'm not going to tell you it's something like a ball bearing

  <p>I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining
 something that I'm trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For
 instance, the mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and
 they're all excited. As they're telling me the conditions of the 
theorem, I construct something which fits all the conditions. You know, 
you have a set (one ball) – disjoint (two balls). Then the balls turn 
colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head as they put more conditions 
on. Finally they state the theorem, which is some dumb thing about the 
ball which isn't true for my hairy green ball thing, so I say, 'False!'</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It is now clear to us what, in the year 1812, was the 
cause of the destruction of the French army. No one will dispute that 
the cause of the destruction of Napoleon's French forces was, on the one
 hand, their advance late in the year, without preparations for a winter
 march, into the depths of Russia, and, on the other hand, the character
 that the war took on with the burning of Russian towns and the hatred 
of the foe aroused in the Russian people. But then not only did no one 
foresee (what now seems obvious) that this was the only way that could 
lead to the destruction of an army of eight hundred thousand men, the 
best in the world and led by the best generals, in conflict with a twice
 weaker Russian army, inexperienced and led by inexperienced generals; 
not only did <em>no one foresee this</em>, but all efforts <em>on the part of the Russians</em> were constantly aimed at hindering the one thing that could save Russia, and, <em>on the part of the French</em>,
 despite Napoleon's experience and so-called military genius, all 
efforts were aimed at extending as far as Moscow by the end of summer, 
that is, at doing the very thing that was to destroy them.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Leo Tolstoy, "War and Peace", trans. Pevear and Volokhonsky</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions 
without having to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other 
people's. I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away 
unconsciously from ideas I knew would be hard to sell. When I notice 
something surprising, it's usually very faint at first. There's nothing 
more than a slight stirring of discomfort. I don't want anything to get 
in the way of noticing it consciously.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/discover.html" rel="nofollow">Paul Graham</a></li></ul>

<p><em>I have  met  people  who  exaggerate  the  differences [between the morality of different cultures], because they  have not
distinguished  between  differences of  morality and differences  of  belief
about  facts. For example, one  man said  to  me, "Three  hundred  years ago
people in England were putting witches to death.  Was that what you call the
Rule of Human  Nature or Right Conduct?"  But  surely  the reason we do  not
execute  witches is  that  we  do  not believe there are such  things. If we
did-if  we really thought that there  were people going about  who had  sold
themselves  to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return
and were using  these powers to kill their neighbours or drive  them mad  or
bring bad weather,  surely we  would all agree that  if  anyone deserved the
death penalty, then these filthy quislings did.  There  is  no difference of
moral principle here: the difference is simply about  matter of fact. It may
be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral
advance in  not  executing them  when you  do  not think they are there. You
would not call a  man humane  for ceasing  to  set  mousetraps if  he did so
because he believed there were no mice in the house.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upon his death man must leave everything behind ... and depart 
forever from the world he has known. He must of necessity go to that 
foul land of death, a fact which makes death the most sorrowful of all 
events. ... Some foreign doctrines, however, teach that death should not
 be regarded as profoundly sorrowful. ... These are all gross deceptions
 contrary to human sentiment and fundamental truths. Not to be happy 
over happy events, not to be saddened by sorrowful events, not to show
  surprise at astonishing events, in a word, to consider it proper not 
to be moved by whatever happens, are all foreign types of deception and 
falsehood. They are contrary to human nature and extremely repugnant to 
me.</p></blockquote>

  <p>We live in a world where it has become "politically correct" to 
avoid absolutes. Many want all religions to be given the same honor, and
 all gods regarded as equally true and equally fictitious. But take 
these same people, who want fuzzy, all-inclusive thinking in spiritual 
matters, and put them on an airplane. You will find they insist on a 
very dogmatic, intolerant pilot who will stay on the "straight and 
narrow" glidepath so their life will not come to a violent end short of 
the runway. They want no fuzzy thinking here!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Magic is just a way of saying 'I don't know.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Terry Pratchett, "Nation"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The essence of magic is to do away with underlying mechanisms. ... 
What makes the elephant disappear is the movement of the wand and the 
intent of the magician, directly. If there were any intervening 
processes, it would not be magic but just engineering. As soon as you 
know how the magician made the elephant disappear, the magic disappears 
and -- if you started by believing in magic -- the disappointment sets 
in.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the autumn of 1939, Ludwig Wittgenstein and his young Cambridge 
student and friend Norman Malcolm were walking along the river when they
 saw a newspaper vendor's sign announcing that the Germans had accused 
the British government of instigating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Elser" rel="nofollow">a recent attempt</a>
 to assassinate Hitler. When Wittgenstein remarked that it wouldn't 
surprise him at all if it were true, Malcolm retorted that it was 
impossible because "the British were too civilized and decent to attempt
 anything so underhand, and . . . such an act was incompatible with the 
British 'national character'." Wittgenstein was furious. Some five years
 later, he wrote to Malcolm:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Whenever I thought of you I couldn't help thinking of a 
particular incident which seemed to me very important. . . . you made a 
remark about 'national character' that shocked me by its primitiveness. I
 then thought: <em>what is the use of studying philosophy if all that it
 does for you is to enable you to talk with some plausibility about some
 abstruse questions of logic, etc.,  if it does not improve your 
thinking about the important questions of everyday life</em>, if it does
 not make you more conscientious than any . . . journalist in the use of
 the DANGEROUS phrases such people use for their own ends."</p>
  </blockquote></blockquote>

<p>--Marjorie Perloff, <a href="http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/perloff/witt_intro.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Wittgensteins Ladder</em></a>; apparently of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler" rel="nofollow">many attempts</a>, the one referred to did not actually have British backing, although some did eg. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oster_Conspiracy" rel="nofollow">Oster Conspiracy</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Foxley" rel="nofollow">Operation Foxley</a>.</p>

<p>(This is the full and original quote; the emphasis is on the section 
which is usually paraphrased as, "What is the use of studying philosophy
 if all that it does for you is to enable you to talk with some 
plausibility about some abstruse questions of logic...if it does not 
improve your thinking about the important questions of everyday life?")</p>

<blockquote><p>Already I had learned from thee that because a thing is 
eloquently expressed it should not be taken to be as necessarily true; 
nor because it is uttered with stammering lips should it be supposed 
false. Nor, again, is it necessarily true because rudely uttered, nor 
untrue because the language is brilliant. Wisdom and folly both are like
 meats that are wholesome and unwholesome, and courtly or simple words 
are like town-made or rustic vessels — both kinds of food may be served 
in either kind of dish.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/" rel="nofollow">Saint Augustine of Hippo</a>, <em>Confessions</em></p>

<blockquote><p>[Political "gaffe" stories] are completely 
information-free news events, and they absolutely dominate political 
news coverage and analysis. It's like asking your doctor if the X-rays 
show a tumor, and all he'll talk about is how stupid the radiologist's 
haircut looks. . . . ["Blast"] stories are. . . just as content-free as 
the "gaffe" stories. But they are popular for the same reason: There's a
 petty, tribal satisfaction in seeing a member of our team really put 
the other team in their place. And there's a rush of outrage adrenaline 
when the other team says something mean about us. So, instead of 
covering pending legislation or the impact it could have on your life, 
the news media covers the dick-measuring contest.</p></blockquote><p>-David Wong, <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-ways-to-spot-b.s.-political-story-in-under-10-seconds/#ixzz1u7boUvCJ" rel="nofollow">5 Ways to Spot a B.S. Political Story in Under 10 Seconds</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose we find a society which lacks our understanding 
of human physiology, and that speaks a language just like English, 
except for one curious family of idioms. When they are tired they talk 
of being beset by <em>fatigues</em>, of having mental fatigues, muscular
 fatigues, fatigues in the eyes and fatigues of the the spirit. Their 
sports lore contains such maxims as 'too many fatigues spoils your aim' 
and 'five fatigues in the legs are worth ten in the arms'. When we 
encounter them and tell them of our science, they want to know <em>what fatigues are</em>.
 They have been puzzling over such questions as whether numerically the 
same fatigue can come and go and return, whether fatigues have a 
definite location in matter and space and time, whether fatigues are 
identical with some physical states or processes or events in their 
bodies, or are made of some sort of stuff. We can see that they are off 
to a bad start with these questions, but what should we tell them? One 
thing we can tell them is that there simply are no such things as 
fatigues - they have a confused ontology. We can expect them to retort: 
'You don't think there are fatigues? Run around the block a few times 
and you'll know better! There are many things your science might teach 
us, but the non-existence of fatigues isn't one of them!</p></blockquote><p>--Dan Dennett, <em>Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology</em></p>

<blockquote><p>“Why do you read so much?”</p><p>Tyrion looked up at the 
sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him
 curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, “Look at me and 
tell me what you see.”</p><p>The boy looked at him suspiciously. “Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion Lannister.”</p><p>Tyrion sighed. “You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?”</p><p>“Fourteen,” the boy said.</p><p>“Fourteen,
 and you’re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, 
and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from 
falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be interested 
to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, 
but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I been born a 
peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver’s
 grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the 
grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father 
was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My brother later killed that 
very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little 
ironies. My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be 
king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn’t 
you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my 
head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough 
for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and 
weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert 
has his warhammer, and I have my mind… and a mind needs books as a sword
 needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.” Tyrion tapped the 
leather cover of the book. “That’s why I read so much, Jon Snow.”</p></blockquote><p>--George R. R. Martin, <em>A Game of Thrones</em></p>

<blockquote><p>I was once, years and years ago, falsely accused by 
someone of egregious dishonesty, and after I put forward evidence that 
the accusation was false, was told, "Let's just agree to disagree." At 
which, of course, I exploded; I would not be agreeing to disagree about 
whether I had been completely dishonest, thank you very much. And every 
time someone uses the phrase I am tempted to say, "We don't need to 
agree to disagree because we already are disagreeing." I think what gets
 me is that it's such an unbelievably low standard that almost anything 
would be more intellectually robust; why not agree to something more 
ambitiously intellectual, like swapping book recommendations, or having a
 temporary cooling-off period, or going to a third party for arbitration
 or advice, or anything else, really?</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://branemrys.blogspot.com/2012/12/lets-not-agree-to-disagree.html" rel="nofollow">Brandon Watson</a>.</li></ul>

nothing, because what gets released in a single year is a close to a

<blockquote><p>“To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, 
you need to be able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying 
through clouds. Without visual cues (e.g. the horizon) you can't 
distinguish between gravity and acceleration. Which means if you're 
flying through clouds you can't tell what the attitude of the aircraft 
is. You could feel like you're flying straight and level while in fact 
you're descending in a spiral. The solution is to ignore what your body 
is telling you and listen only to your instruments. But it turns out to 
be very hard to ignore what your body is telling you. Every pilot knows 
about this problem and yet it is still a leading cause of accidents. You
 need to do what you know intellectually to be right, even though it 
feels wrong.”</p></blockquote><p>-Paul Graham</p>

<blockquote><p>One test adults use is whether you still have the kid 
flake reflex. When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something 
hard, you can cry and say "I can't do it" and the adults will probably 
let you off. As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying 
"I'm just a kid" that will get you out of most difficult situations. 
Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake. They still do, 
of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.</p></blockquote><p>-Paul Graham</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes the most remarkable things seem commonplace. I 
mean, when you think about it, jet travel is pretty freaking remarkable.
 You get in a plane, it defies the gravity of an entire planet by 
exploiting a loophole with air pressure, and it flies across distances 
that would take months or years to cross by any means of travel that has
 been significant for more than a century or three. You hurtle above the
 earth at enough speed to kill you instantly should you bump into 
something, and you can only breathe because someone built you a really 
good tin can that has seams tight enough to hold in a decent amount of 
air. Hundreds of millions of man-hours of work and struggle and 
research, blood, sweat, tears, and lives have gone into the history of 
air travel, and it has totally revolutionized the face of our planet and
 societies.</p><p>But get on any flight in the country, and I absolutely
 promise you that you will find someone who, in the face of all that 
incredible achievement, will be willing to complain about the drinks.</p><p>The drinks, people.</p></blockquote><p>--Harry Dresden, Summer Knight, Jim Butcher</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It helps to stop worrying about what you <em>are</em> and concentrate on what you <em>do</em>.
 If you think of a poet as a person with some special qualifications 
that come by nature (or divine favor), you are likely to make one of two
 mistakes about yourself. If you think you've got what it takes, you may
 fail to learn what you need to know in order to use whatever qualities 
you may have. On the other hand, if you think you do not have what it 
takes, you may give up too easily, thinking it is useless to try. A poet
 is someone - you, me, anyone - who writes poems. That question out of 
the way, now we can learn to write poems better.</p></blockquote>

  <p>I know that most men — not only those considered clever, but even 
those who are very clever and capable of understanding most difficult 
scientific, mathematical, or philosophic, problems — can seldom discern 
even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as obliges them 
to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much 
difficulty — conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught
 to others, and on which they have built their lives.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Lottery tickets should not be free. In such purely random and 
independent events as the lottery, the probability of having a winning 
number depends directly on the number of tickets you have purchased. 
When one evaluates the outcome of a scientific work, attention must be 
given not only to the potential interest of the ‘significant’ outcomes 
but also to the number of ‘lottery tickets’ the authors have ‘bought’. 
Those having many have a much higher chance of ‘winning a lottery prize’
 than of getting a meaningful scientific result. It would be unfair not 
to distinguish between significant results of well-planned, powerful, 
sharply focused studies, and those from ‘fishing expeditions’ with a 
much higher probability of catching an old truck tyre than of a really 
big fish."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of a milk bottle:</p><blockquote><p>It is of interest that when the 
[milk] bottle is half filled with milk it is more often described as 
half empty, but when it is half filled with water it tends to be 
described as half full. This probably happens because in the case of the
 milk one is working downward from a full bottle but in the case of the 
water one is working upward from an empty milk bottle. The history of a

<blockquote><p>"What really is the point of trying to teach anything to 
anybody?"
This question seemed to provoke a murmur of sympathetic approval from up
 and down the table.
Richard continued, "What I mean is that if you really want to understand
 something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That 
forces you to sort it out in your mind. And the more slow and dim-witted
 your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more 
simple ideas. And that's really the essence of programming. By the time 
you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a 
stupid machine can deal with, you've learned something about it 
yourself."</p></blockquote><p>Douglas Adams, <em>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</em></p>

<blockquote><p>After I spoke at the 2005 "Mathematics and Narrative" 
conference in Mykonos, a suggestion was made that proofs by 
contradiction are the mathematician's version of irony. I'm not sure I 
agree with that: when we give a proof by contradiction, we make it very 
clear that we are discussing a counterfactual, so our words <em>are</em> intended to be taken at face value. But perhaps this is not necessary. Consider the following passage.</p><blockquote><p>There
 are those who would believe that every polynomial equation with integer
 coefficients has a rational solution, a view that leads to some 
intriguing new ideas. For example, take the equation x² - 2 = 0. Let p/q
 be a rational solution. Then (p/q)² - 2 = 0, from which it follows that
 p² = 2q². The highest power of 2 that divides p² is obviously an even 
power, since if 2^k is the highest power of 2 that divides p, then 2^2k 
is the highest power of 2 that divides p². Similarly, the highest power 
of 2 that divides 2q² is an odd power, since it is greater by 1 than the
 highest power that divides q². Since p² and 2q² are equal, there must 
exist a positive integer that is both even and odd. Integers with this 
remarkable property are quite unlike the integers we are familiar with: 
as such, they are surely worthy of further study.</p></blockquote><p>I 
find that it conveys the irrationality of √2 rather forcefully. But 
could mathematicians afford to use this literary device? How would a 
reader be able to tell the difference in intent between what I have just
 written and the following superficially similar passage?</p><blockquote><p>There
 are those who would believe that every polynomial equation has a 
solution, a view that leads to some intriguing new ideas. For example, 
take the equation x² + 1 = 0. Let <em>i</em> be a solution of this equation. Then <em>i</em>² + 1 = 0, from which it follows that <em>i</em>² = -1. We know that <em>i</em> cannot be positive, since then <em>i</em>² would be positive. Similarly, <em>i</em> cannot be negative, since <em>i</em>² would again be positive (because the product of two negative numbers is always positive). And <em>i</em>
 cannot be 0, since 0² = 0. It follows that we have found a number that 
is not positive, not negative, and not zero. Numbers with this 
remarkable property are quite unlike the numbers we are familiar with: 
as such, they are surely worthy of further study.</p></blockquote></blockquote><ul><li>Timothy Gowers, <em>Vividness in Mathematics and Narrative</em>, in <em>Circles Disturbed: The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative</em></li></ul>

<blockquote><p>“The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can 
play. That’s why we have to destroy the present politico-economic 
system.” This may sound like the pronouncement of some bong-smoking 
anarchist, but it was actually Arthur C. Clarke, who found time between 
scuba diving and pinball games to write “Childhood’s End” and think up 
communications satellites. My old colleague Ted Rall recently wrote a 
column proposing that we divorce income from work and give each citizen a
 guaranteed paycheck, which sounds like the kind of lunatic notion 
that’ll be considered a basic human right in about a century, like 
abolition, universal suffrage and eight-hour workdays. The Puritans 
turned work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it as a
 punishment.</p></blockquote><p>-- <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/" rel="nofollow">Tim Kreider</a></p><p>The

<blockquote><p>Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason. 
We all need to take a cold hard look at the evidence and see reasoning 
for what it is. ... [M]ost of the bizarre and depressing research 
findings [about cognitive biases] make perfect sense once you see 
reasoning as having evolved not to help us find the truth but to help us
 engage in arguments, persuasion, and manipulation in the context of 
discussions with other people.</p><p>I'm not saying we should all stop 
reasoning and go with our gut feelings. Gut feelings are sometimes 
better guides than reasoning for making consumer choices and 
interpersonal judgments, but they are often disastrous as a basis for 
public policy, science, and law. Rather, what I'm saying is that we must
 be wary of any /individual/'s ability to reason. We should see each 
individual as being limited, like a neuron. A neuron is really good at 
one thing: summing up the stimulation coming into its dendrites to 
'decide' whether to fire a pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself 
isn't very smart. But if you put neurons together in the right way you 
get a brain; you get an emergent system that is much smarter and more 
flexible than a single neuron.</p><p>In the same way, each individual 
reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the 
position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We 
should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, 
truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational
 concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right 
way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to 
disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common 
bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create
 a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property 
of the social system. This is why it's so important to have intellectual
 and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is
 to find truth.</p></blockquote><p>--Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind</p>

<blockquote><p>A person is said to exhibit rational irrationality when it is <em>instrumentally</em> rational for him to be <em>epistemically</em> irrational. An <em>instrumentally</em> rational person chooses the best strategies to achieve his goals. An <em>epistemically</em>
 irrational person ignores and evades evidence against his beliefs, 
holds his beliefs without evidence or with only weak evidence, has 
contradictions in his thinking, employs logical fallacies in belief 
formation, and exhibits characteristic epistemic vices such as 
closed-mindedness. Epistemically irrational political beliefs can 
reinforce one’s self-image; boost one’s self-esteem; make one feel 
noble, smart, superior, safe, or comfortable; and can help achieve 
conformity with the group and thus facilitate social acceptance. Thus, 
epistemic irrationality can be instrumentally rational.</p><p>If I 
falsely believe the road I am crossing is free of cars, I might die. So I
 have a strong incentive to form beliefs about the road in a rational 
way. However, if I falsely believe that import quotas are good for the 
economy, this has no directly harmful effects. (On the contrary, the 
belief can have significant instrumental value. It might make me feel 
patriotic; serve my xenophobia; serve as an outlet to rationalize, 
sublimate, or redirect racist attitudes; or help me pretend to have 
solidarity with union workers.) … Epistemic rationality is hard and 
takes self-discipline.</p><p>When it comes to politics, individuals have
 every incentive to indulge their irrational impulses. Demand for 
irrational beliefs is like demand for most other goods. The lower the 
cost, the more will be demanded. The cost to the typical voter of voting
 in epistemically irrational ways is nearly zero. The cost of overcoming
 bias and epistemic irrationality is high. The psychological benefit of 
this irrationality is significant. Thus, voters demand a high amount of 
epistemic irrationality.</p></blockquote><p>Jason Brennan, <a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Ethics_of_Voting.html?id=FNIRmZ09AiAC&amp;redir_esc=y" rel="nofollow">The Ethics of Voting</a>, p.173-74</p>

<p>I've just come across a fascinatingly compact observation by I. J. Good:</p><blockquote><p>Public
 and private utilities do not always coincide. This leads to ethical 
problems. Example - an invention is submitted to a scientific adviser of
 a firm...</p><p>The probability that the invention will work is p. The 
value to the firm if the invention is adopted and works is V, and the 
loss if the invention is adopted and fails is L. The value to the 
adviser personally if he advises the adoption of the invention and it 
works is v, and the loss if it fails to work is l. The losses to the 
firm and the adviser if he recommends the rejection of the invention are
 both negligible...</p><p>Then the firm's expected gain if the invention
 is adopted is pV - (1-p)L and the adviser's expected gain in the same 
circumstances is pv - (1-p)l. The firm has positive expected gain if 
p/(1-p)  L/V, and the adviser has positive expected gain if p/(1-p)  
l/v.</p><p>If l/v  p/(1-p)  L/V, the adviser will be faced with an 
ethical problem, i.e. he will be tempted to act against the interests of
 the firm.</p></blockquote><p>This is a beautifully simple recipe for a conflict of interest:</p><p>Considering
 absolute losses assuming failure and absolute gains conditioned on 
success, an adviser is incentivized to give the wrong advice, precisely 
when:</p><ul><li>The ratio of agent loss to agent gain,</li><li>exceeds the odds of success versus failure</li><li>which in turn exceeds the ratio of principal loss to principal gain.</li></ul><p>You can see this reflected in a <em>lot</em>
 of cases because the gains to an advisor often don't scale anywhere 
near as fast as the gains to society or a firm. It's the Fearful 
Committee Formula.</p>

<blockquote><p>Within the philosophy of science, the view that new 
discoveries constitute a break with tradition was challenged by Polanyi,
 who argued that discoveries may be made by the sheer power of believing
 more strongly than anyone else in current theories, rather than going 
beyond the paradigm. For example, the theory of Brownian motion which 
Einstein produced in 1905, may be seen as a literal articulation of the 
kinetic theory of gases at the time. As Polanyi said:</p><blockquote><p>Discoveries
 made by the surprising configuration of existing theories might in fact
 be likened to the feat of a Columbus whose genius lay in taking 
literally and as a guide to action that the earth was round, which his 
contemporaries held vaguely and as a mere matter for speculation.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>― David Lamb  Susan M. Easton, <em>Multiple Discovery: The pattern of scientific progress</em>, pp. 100-101</p>

<blockquote><p>One interesting thing about Ms. Dowd’s description of 
“hardball” political tactics is just how dainty and genteel her brass 
knuckle suggestions actually are. A speech, an appeal to reason: there 
is nothing here about lucrative contracts for political supporters, 
promises of sinecure jobs for politicians who lose their seats, a “blank
 check” for administrative backing on some obscure tax loophole that a 
particular politician could award to a favored client; there’s not even a
 delicate hint about grand jury investigations that can be stopped in 
their tracks or compromising photographs or wiretaps that need never see
 the light of day. Far be it from Ms Dowd to speak of or even hint at 
the kind of strategy that actual politicians think about when words like
 ‘hardball’ come to mind. Ms Dowd speaks of brass knuckles and then 
shows us a doily; at some level it speaks well of Ms. Dowd as a human 
being that even when she tries she seems unable to come up with an offer
 someone can’t refuse.</p></blockquote><p>-- Walter Russell Mead, <a href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2013/04/21/gentry-liberals-and-brass-knuckles-the-case-of-maureen-dowd/" rel="nofollow">describing</a> someone else's failure to understand what a desperate effort actually looks like.</p>

<blockquote><p>The word <em>gentleman</em> originally meant something 
recognisable: one who had a coat of arms and some landed property. When 
you called someone 'a gentleman' you were not paying him a compliment, 
but merely stating a fact. If you said he was not 'a gentleman' you were
 not insulting him, but giving information. There was no contradiction 
in saying that John was a liar and a gentleman; any more than there now 
is in saying that James is a fool and an M.A. But then there came people
 who said- so rightly, charitably, spiritually, sensitively, so anything
 but usefully- 'Ah, but surely the important thing about a gentleman is 
not the coat of arms and the land, but the behaviour? Surely he is the 
true gentleman who behaves as a gentleman should? Surely in that sense 
Edward is far more truly a gentleman than John?' They meant well. To be 
honourable and courteous and brave is of course a far better thing than 
to have a coat of arms. But it is not the same thing. Worse still, it is
 not a thing everyone will agree about. To call a man 'a gentleman' in 
this new, refined sense, becomes, in fact, not a way of giving 
information about him, but a way of praising him: to deny that he is 'a 
gentleman' becomes simply a way of insulting him. <strong>When a word 
ceases to be a term of description and becomes merely a term of praise, 
it no longer tells you facts about the object; it only tells you about 
the speaker's attitude to that object.</strong> (A 'nice' meal only means a meal the speaker likes.) A <em>gentleman</em>,
 once it has been spiritualised and refined out of its old coarse, 
objective sense, means hardly more than a man whom the speaker likes. As
 a result, <em>gentleman</em> is now a useless word. We had lots of 
terms of approval already, so it was not needed for that use; on the 
other hand if anyone (say, in a historical work) wants to use it in its 
old sense, he cannot do so without explanations. It has been spoiled for
 that purpose.</p></blockquote><ul><li>C.S. Lewis (emphasis my own)</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>the mass of an object never seems to change: a spinning 
top has the same weight as a still one. So a “law” was invented: mass is
 constant, independent of speed. That “law” is now found to be 
incorrect. Mass is found to increase with velocity, but appreciable 
increases require velocities near that of light. A <em>true</em> law is:
 if an object moves with a speed of less than one hundred miles a second
 the mass is constant to within one part in a million. In some such 
approximate form this is a correct law. So in practice one might think 
that the new law makes no significant difference. Well, yes and no. For 
ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it and use the simple 
constant-mass law as a good approximation. But for high speeds we are 
wrong, and the higher the speed, the more wrong we are.</p><p>Finally, and most interesting, <em>philosophically we are completely wrong</em>
 with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be 
altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a 
very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws.
 Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our 
ideas.</p></blockquote><p>Richard Feynman <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html" rel="nofollow">Lectures on Physics</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On some pitch black mornings, hearing what I knew was a
  cold wind howling outside, I might think, "Well, it is
  certainly comfortable in this bed, and maybe it wouldn't
  hurt if I just skipped practicing to-day."  But my
  response to this was not to draw on something called will
  power, to insult or threaten myself, but to take a longer
  look at my life, to extend my vision, to think about the
  whole of my experience, to reconnect present and future,
  and quite specifically, to ask myself, "Do you like
  playing the cello or not?  Would you like to play it
  better or not?"  When I put the matter this way I could
  see that I enjoyed playing the cello more than I enjoyed
  staying in bed.  So I got up.  If, as sometimes happened
  or happens, I do stay in bed, not sleeping, not really
  thinking, but just not getting up, it is not because will
  power is weak but because I have temporarily become
  disconnected, so to speak, from the wholeness of my life.
  I am living in that Now that some people pursue so

  <p>To sum up: it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.</p>
  
  <p>If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or 
persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which 
arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and 
the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards as
 impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing
 it--the life of that man is one long sin against mankind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most serious problems with modern "management" is that 
the incentives are all wrong. Imagine that I hire a programmer and pay 
him by the line of code. This idea has been so thoroughly debunked that 
it is nearly impossible to write out the consequences without sounding 
cliché. Yet it happens all the time: Companies promote "Architects" who 
are evaluated by the weight of their "architecture." The result is 
stultifying and demoralizing. The architect does not work to facilitate 
the programmer's work, he works to produce evidence of his contribution 
in the form of frameworks, standards, and software process.</p>
  
  <p>So, how are most managers evaluated? By the amount of "managing" 
they do, as measured by the amount of process they impose on their team.
 Evaluating a manager by the amount of managing they <em>do</em> is 
exactly the same thing as evaluating a programmer by the amount of code 
they write. And it produces results like you describe, where the manager
 works to produce evidence of their management in the form of processes 
and decisions from the top down, rather than facilitating the work 
actually being done.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Don't you feel in your heart that these contradictions do not 
really contradict: that there is a cosmos that contains them all? The 
soul goes round upon a wheel of stars and all things return; perhaps 
Strake and I have striven in many shapes, beast against beast and bird 
against bird, and perhaps we shall strive for ever. But since we seek 
and need each other, even that eternal hatred is an eternal love. Good 
and evil go round in a wheel that is one thing and not many. Do you not 
realize in your heart, do you not believe behind all your beliefs, that 
there is but one reality and we are its shadows; and that all things are
 but aspects of one thing: a centre where men melt into Man and Man into
 God?'</p>

  <p>People can learn to look you in the eyes even when they're lying to
 you. But it's kind of like a fake smile; there are involuntary muscles 
up there. If you know what you're looking for, you can still tell.  But 
what does it mean if they're looking you in the eyes and they mean it? 
It means that, at least in that moment, they're doing what they really 
believe is right. That's the definition of integrity.</p>
  
  <p>That part is easy. That's not the surprising thing.</p>
  
  <p>The surprising thing, to me, was that someone can have integrity 
and still be completely evil. It's kind of obvious in retrospect; the 
super-villain in an action movie can always look the hero in the eye, 
and he always does, just to prove it. He has integrity. Evil with 
integrity is more respectable, somehow, than plain evil.  All it takes 
to have integrity is to do what you think is right, no matter how stupid
 that may be.</p>

<blockquote><p>...some people requested that I be prohibited from 
studying.
One time they achieved it through a very holy and simple mother superior
 who believed that studying would get me in trouble with the Inquisition
 and ordered me not to do it. I obeyed her for the three months that she
 was in office in as far as I did not touch a book, but as far as 
absolutely not studying, this was not in my power.
[...]
Even the people I spoke to, and what they said to me, gave rise to 
thousands of reflections. What was the source of all the variety of 
personality and talent I found among them, since they were all one 
species?
[...]
Sometimes I would pace in front of the fireplace in one of our large 
dormitories and notice that, though the lines of two sides were parallel
 and its ceiling level, to our vision it appears as though the lines are
 inclined toward each other and the ceiling is lower in the distance 
than it is nearby. From this it can be inferred that the lines of our 
vision run straight, but not parallel, to form the figure of a pyramid. 
And I wondered if that was the reason that the ancients questioned 
whether the earth was a sphere or not. Because although it seemed so, 
their vision might have deceived them, showing concave shapes where 
there were none.
[...]
Once I saw two girls playing with a top, and hardly had I seen the 
movement and the shape when I began, in my insane way, to consider the 
easy movement of the spherical shape and how long the momentum, once 
established, remained independent of its original cause, the distant 
hand of the girl. Not content with this I had flour brought and 
sprinkled on the floor in order to discover whether the spinning top 
would describe perfect circles or not. It turned out that they were not 
perfect circles but spirals that lost their circular shape to the degree
 that the top lost momentum.</p></blockquote><p>Sister Juana Inés de la Cruz, 1691 (tr. Pamela Kirk Rappaport)</p>

<p>On politics as the mind-killer:</p><blockquote><p>We’re at the point where people are <em>morally certain</em>
 about the empirical facts of what happened between Trayvon Martin and 
George Zimmerman on the basis of their general political worldviews. 
This isn’t exactly surprising—we are tribal creatures who like master 
narratives—but it feels as though it’s gotten more pronounced recently, 
and it’s almost certainly making us all stupider.</p></blockquote><p>-- <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2012/03/30/political-metastasis/" rel="nofollow">Julian Sanchez</a> (the whole post is worth reading)</p>

<blockquote><p>Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding 
or relating; but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes 
of a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of 
small importance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous 
city, and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, 
perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some 
attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is 
produc'd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen,
 as by little advantages that occur every day.</p></blockquote><p>--Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p><em>Baroque Cycle</em> by Neal Stphenson proves to be a very good, intelligent book series.</p><blockquote><p>“Why does the tide rush out to sea?”</p><p>“The influence of the sun and the moon.”</p><p>“Yet
 you and I cannot see the sun or the moon. The water does not have 
senses to see, or a will to follow them. How then do the sun and moon, 
so far away, affect the water?”</p><p>“Gravity,” responded Colonel 
Barnes, lowering his voice like a priest intoning the name of God, and 
glancing about to see whether Sir Isaac Newton were in earshot.</p><p>“That’s
 what everyone says now. ’Twas not so when I was a lad. We used to 
parrot Aristotle and say it was in the nature of water to be drawn up by
 the moon. Now, thanks to our fellow-passenger, we say ‘gravity.’ It 
seems a great improvement. But is it really? Do you understand the 
tides, Colonel Barnes, simply because you know to say ‘gravity’?”</p></blockquote><p>Daniel Waterhouse and Colonel Barnes in <em>Solomon’s Gold</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Mike nodded. He wasn't really surprised, though. One of 
the things he'd come to learn since the Ring of Fire, all the way down 
to the marrow of his bones, was that if the ancestors of 
twentieth-century human beings didn't do something that seemed logical, 
it was probably because it wasn't actually logical at all, once you 
understood everything involved. So it turned out that such notorious 
military numbskulls as Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Phil Sheridan, 
Stonewall Jackson, William Tecumseh Sherman and all the rest of them 
hadn't actually been idiots after all. It was easy for twentieth-century
 professors to proclaim loftily that Civil War generals had insisted on 
continuing with line formations despite the advent of the Minié 
ball-armed rifled musket because the dimwits simply hadn't noticed that 
the guns were accurate for several hundred yards. When—cluck; cluck—they
 should obviously have adopted the skirmishing tactics of 
twentieth-century infantry.</p><p>But it turned out, when put to a 
ruthless seventeenth-century Swedish general's test in his very rigorous
 notion of field exercises, that those professors of a later era had 
apparently never tried to stand their ground when cavalry came at them. 
After they fired their shot, and needed one-third of a minute—if they 
were adept at the business, and didn't get rattled—to have a second shot
 ready. In that bloody world where real soldiers lived and died, 
skirmishing tactics without breechloading rifles or automatic weapons 
were just a way to commit suicide. If the opponent had large enough 
forces and was willing to lose some men, at least.</p></blockquote><p>-- 1634: The Baltic War, by Eric Flint and David Weber</p>

  <p>The light dove, cleaving the air in her free flight, and feeling 
its resistance, might imagine that its flight would be still easier in 
empty space.  It was thus that Plato left the world of the senses, as 
setting too narrow limits to the understanding, and ventured out beyond 
it on the wings of the ideas, in the empty space of the pure 
understanding.  He did not observe that with all his efforts he made no 
advance—meeting no resistance that might, as it were, serve as a support
 upon which he could take a stand, to which he could apply his powers, 
and so set his understanding in motion.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Hanoi, under French colonial rule, a program paying people a 
bounty for each rat pelt handed in was intended to exterminate rats. 
Instead, it led to the farming of rats.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>19th century palaeontologists traveling to China used to pay 
peasants for each fragment of dinosaur bone (dinosaur fossils) that they
 produced. They later discovered that peasants dug up the bones and then
 smashed them into multiple pieces to maximise their payments.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Rule I</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.</em></p>
  
  <p>To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in 
vain, and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased 
with simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Rule II</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.</em></p>
  
  <p>As to respiration in a man and in a beast; the descent of stones in <em>Europe</em> and in <em>America</em>; the light of our culinary fire and of the sun; the reflection of light in the earth, and in the planets.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Rule III</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intensification 
nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies 
within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal 
qualities of all bodies whatsoever.</em></p>
  
  <p>For since the qualities of bodies are only known to us by 
experiments, we are to hold for universal all such as universally agree 
with experiments; and such as are not liable to diminution can never be 
quite taken away. We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence for 
the sake of dreams and vain fictions of our own devising; nor are we to 
recede from the analogy of Nature, which is wont to be simple, and 
always consonant to itself. . .</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Rule IV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions 
inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very 
nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be 
imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may 
either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.</em></p>
  
  <p>This rule we must follow, that the argument of induction may not be evaded by hypotheses.</p></blockquote>

<p>From desert cliff and mountaintop we trace the wide design, <br><br>
Strike-slip fault and overthrust and syn and anticline... <br><br>
We gaze upon creation where erosion makes it known, <br><br>
And count the countless aeons in the banding of the stone. <br><br>
Odd, long-vanished creatures and their tracks  shells are found; <br><br>
Where truth has left its sketches on the slate below the ground. <br><br>
The patient stone can speak, if we but listen when it talks. <br><br>
Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the rocks.</p>

<p>There are those who name the stars, who watch the sky by night, <br><br>
Seeking out the darkest place, to better see the light. <br><br>
Long ago, when torture broke the remnant of his will, <br><br>
Galileo recanted, but the Earth is moving still. <br><br>
High above the mountaintops, where only distance bars, <br><br>
The truth has left its footprints in the dust between the stars. <br><br>
We may watch and study or may shudder and deny, <br><br>
Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the sky.</p>

<p>By stem and root and branch we trace, by feather, fang and fur, <br><br>
How the living things that are descend from things that were. <br><br>
The moss, the kelp, the zebrafish, the very mice and flies, <br><br>
These tiny, humble, wordless things--how shall they tell us lies? <br><br>
We are kin to beasts; no other answer can we bring. <br><br>
The truth has left its fingerprints on every living thing. <br><br>
Remember, should you have to choose between them in the strife, <br><br>
Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote life.</p>

<p>And we who listen to the stars, or walk the dusty grade, <br><br>
Or break the very atoms down to see how they are made, <br><br>
Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand. <br><br>
The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand. <br><br>
Deep in flower and in flesh, in star and soil and seed, <br><br>
The truth has left its living word for anyone to read. <br><br>
So turn and look where best you think the story is unfurled. <br><br>
Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the world.</p>

<p>In the Information Age, the first step to sanity is FILTERING.
Filter the information; extract the knowledge.</p>

<p>Filter first for substance.  Filter second for significance.
These filters protect against advertising.</p>

<p>Filter third for reliability.  This filter protects against politicians.</p>

<p>Filter fourth for completeness.  This filter protects from the media.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Three Virtues of a Programmer:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Laziness</strong> - The quality that makes you go to 
great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write 
labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document 
what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Impatience</strong> - The anger you feel when the 
computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just 
react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend 
to.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Hubris</strong> - Excessive pride, the sort of thing 
Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) 
programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.</p></li>
  </ul></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose I think, after doing my accounts, that I have a large 
balance at the bank. And suppose you want to find out whether this 
belief of mine is "wishful thinking." You can never come to any 
conclusion by examining my psychological condition. Your only chance of 
finding out is to sit down and work through the sum yourself. When you 
have checked my figures, then, and then only, will you know whether I 
have that balance or not. If you find my arithmetic correct, then no 
amount of vapouring about my psychological condition can be anything but
 a waste of time. If you find my arithmetic wrong, then it may be 
relevant to explain psychologically how I came to be so bad at my 
arithmetic, and the doctrine of the concealed wish will become relevant —
 but only after you have yourself done the sum and discovered me to be 
wrong on purely arithmetical grounds. It is the same with all thinking 
and all systems of thought. If you try to find out which are tainted by 
speculating about the wishes of the thinkers, you are merely making a 
fool of yourself. You must first find out on purely logical grounds 
which of them do, in fact, break down as arguments. Afterwards, if you 
like, go on and discover the psychological causes of the error.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What really matters is:–</p><ol><li><p>Always try to use the language so as to make quite clear what you mean and make sure your sentence couldn't mean anything else.</p></li><li><p>Always prefer the plain direct word to the long, vague one. Don't <em>implement</em> promises, but <em>keep</em> them.</p></li><li><p>Never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean "More people died" don't say "Mortality rose."</p></li><li><p>In
 writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want us to 
feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of telling us a
 thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be terrified. Don't say
 it was "delightful"; make <em>us</em> say "delightful" when we've read 
the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, 
hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers, "Please will 
you do my job for me."</p></li><li><p>Don't use words too big for the

<blockquote><p>In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You

they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view

<blockquote><p>...a good way of thinking about minimalism [about truth] 
and its attractions is to see it as substituting the particular for the 
general. It mistrusts anything abstract or windy. Both the relativist 
and the absolutist are impressed by Pilate's notorious question 'What is
 Truth?', and each tries to say something useful at the same high and 
vertiginous level of generality. The minimalist can be thought of 
turning his back on this abstraction, and then in any particular case he
 prefaces his answer with the prior injunction: <em>you tell me</em>. 
This does not mean, 'You tell me what truth is.' It means, 'You tell me 
what the issue is, and I will tell you (although you will already know, 
by then) what the truth about the issue consists in.' If the issue is 
whether high tide is at midday, then truth consists in high tide being 
at midday... We can tell you what truth amounts to, if you first tell us
 what the issue is.</p><p>There is a very powerful argument for 
minimalism about truth, due to the great logician Gottlob Frege. First, 
we should notice the <em>transparency</em> property of truth. This is 
the fact that it makes no difference whether you say that it is raining,
 or it is true that it is raining, or true that it is true that it is 
raining, and so on forever. But if 'it is true that' introduced some 
substantial, robust property of a judgment, how could this be so? 
Consider, for example, a pragmatism that attempts some equation between 
truth and utility. Then next to the judgment 'it is raining' we might 
have 'it is useful to believe that it is raining.' But these are 
entirely different things! To assess the first we direct our attention 
to the weather. To assess the second we direct our attention to the 
results of believing something about the weather - a very different 
investigation.</p><p>Let us return to Pilate. Where does minimalism about truth leave him? It suggests that when he asked this question, he was <em>distracting</em>
 himself and his audience from his real job, which was to find out 
whether to uphold certain specific historical charges against a 
defendant. Thus, if I am innocent, and I come before a judge, I don't 
want airy generalities about the nature of truth. I want him to find 
that I did not steal the watch if I did not steal the watch. I want him 
to rub his nose in the issue. I want a local judgment about a local or 
specific event, supposed to have happened in a particular region of time
 and space.</p></blockquote><p>(Simon Blackburn, <em>Truth</em>)</p>

<p>"In a society in which the narrow pursuit of material self-interest 
is the norm, the shift to an ethical stance is more radical than many 
people realize. In comparison with the needs of people starving in 
Somalia, the desire to sample the wines of the leading French vineyards 
pales into insignificance. Judged against the suffering of immobilized 
rabbits having shampoos dripped into their eyes, a better shampoo 
becomes an unworthy goal. An ethical approach to life does not forbid 
having fun or enjoying food and wine, but it changes our sense of 
priorities. The effort and expense put into buying fashionable clothes, 
the endless search for more and more refined gastronomic pleasures, the 
astonishing additional expense that marks out the prestige car market in
 cars from the market in cars for people who just want a reliable means 
to getting from A to B, all these become disproportionate to people who 
can shift perspective long enough to take themselves, at least for a 
time, out of the spotlight. If a higher ethical consciousness spreads, 
it will utterly change the society in which we live."

<blockquote><p>"The boundary between these 2 classes [the Eloi  
Morlocks] is more porous than I've made it sound. I'm always running 
into regular dudes - construction workers, auto mechanics, taxi drivers,
 galoots in general - who were largely aliterate until something made it
 necessary for them to become readers and start actually thinking about 
things. Perhaps they had to come to grips with alcoholism, perhaps they 
got sent to jail, or came down with a disease, or suffered a crisis in 
religious faith, or simply got bored. Such people can get up to speed on
 particular subjects quite rapidly. Sometimes their lack of a broad 
education makes them over-apt to go off on intellectual wild goose 
chases, but, hey, at least a wild goose chase gives you some exercise."</p></blockquote><p>--Neal Stephenson, <em>In the Beginning Was... the Commandline</em></p><blockquote><p>The
 last project that I worked on with [Richard Feynman] was in simulated 
evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of 
populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands
 of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the 
population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected 
steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real 
biological evolution might also exhibit such "punctuated equilibrium," 
so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was
 feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in 
Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations 
based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went 
to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much 
to my disappointment, all of our "discoveries" were covered in the first
 few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was
 elated. "Hey, we got it right!" he said. "Not bad for amateurs."</p></blockquote><p>From <a href="http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-and-connection-machine/" rel="nofollow">Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine</a></p>

 contradicts the instruments. Pilots are explicitly, emphatically

opposite of the Star

<p>(In a thread where people were asked whether or not they had a religious experience of "feeling God"):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had something similar to feeling God, I suppose, except it was in
 essence the exact opposite. I was in a forest one summer, and I looked 
up at the sunlight shining through the leaves, and suddenly it felt like
 I could see each and every individual leaf in the forest and trace the 
path of each photon that poured through them, and I remember thinking 
over and over, in stunned amazement, "the world is sufficient. The world
 is sufficient."</p>
  
  <p>I'd never thought much about religion before that, but that 
experience made me realize that the material world was entire orders of 
magnitude more beautiful than any of the tawdry religious fantasies 
people came up with, and it felt unspeakably tragic that anyone would 
ever reject this, our most incredible universe, for spiritual 
pipe-dreams. In a way, you might say I felt the lack of god, and it felt
 like glory.</p></blockquote>

<p>The other day I was thinking about Discworld, and then I remembered this and figured it would make a good rationality quote...</p><blockquote><p>[Vimes]
 distrusted the kind of person who'd take one look at another man and 
say in a lordly voice to his companion, "Ah, my dear sir, I can tell you
 nothing except that he is a left-handed stonemason who has spent some 
years in the merchant navy and has recently fell on hard times," and 
then unroll a lot of supercilious commentary about calluses and stance 
and the state of a man's boots, when exactly the same comments could 
apply to a man who was wearing his old clothes because he'd been doing a
 spot of home bricklaying for a new barbecue pit, and had been tattooed 
once when he was drunk and seventeen and in fact got seasick on a wet 
pavement. What arrogance! What an insult to the rich and chaotic variety
 of the human experience!</p></blockquote><p>-- Terry Pratchett, Feet of Clay</p>

certain kind; it was perhaps in a letter to Martin Gardner, reprinted in
 one of his books. The puzzles are those about getting about on an 
island where each native either always tells the truth or always lies. 
You reach a fork in the road, for example, and a native is standing 
there, and you want to learn from him, with one question, which way 
leads to the village. The “correct” question is “If I asked you if the 
left way led to the village, would you say yes?” But why should the 
native’s concept of lying conform to our own logical ideas? If the 
native is a liar, it means he wants to fool you, and your logical 
trickery will not work. The best you can do is say something like “Did 
you hear they are giving away free beer in the village today?” and see 
which way the native runs. You follow him, even if he says something 
like “Ugh, I hate beer!” since then he probably really is lying.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Alexandre Borovik, <a href="http://micromath.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/liars-paradox/" rel="nofollow">quoting</a> an unidentified colleague, paraphrasing another unidentified source, possibly Martin Gardner quoting a letter he got.</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>Lastly, there is an attitude not unknown in the crisis 
against which I should particularly like to protest. I should address my
 protest especially to those lovers and pursuers of Peace who, very 
short-sightedly, have occasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude which
 is impatient of these preliminary details about who did this or that, 
and whether it was right or wrong. They are satisfied with saying that 
an enormous calamity, called War, has been begun by some or all of us; 
and should be ended by some or all of us. To these people this 
preliminary chapter about the precise happenings must appear not only 
dry (and it must of necessity be the driest part of the task) but 
essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell these people that they 
are wrong; that they are wrong upon all principles of human justice and 
historic continuity: but that they are specially and supremely wrong 
upon their own principles of arbitration and international peace.</p><p>These
 sincere and high-minded peace-lovers are always telling us that 
citizens no longer settle their quarrels by private violence; and that 
nations should no longer settle theirs by public violence. They are 
always telling us that we no longer fight duels; and need no longer wage
 wars. In short, they perpetually base their peace proposals on the fact
 that an ordinary citizen no longer avenges himself with an axe. But how
 is he prevented from revenging himself with an axe? If he hits his 
neighbour on the head with the kitchen chopper, what do we do? Do we all
 join hands, like children playing Mulberry Bush, and say "We are all 
responsible for this; but let us hope it will not spread. Let us hope 
for the happy day when he shall leave off chopping at the man's head; 
and when nobody shall ever chop anything for ever and ever." Do we say 
"Let byegones be byegones; why go back to all the dull details with 
which the business began; who can tell with what sinister motives the 
man was standing there within reach of the hatchet?" We do not. We keep 
the peace in private life by asking for the facts of provocation, and 
the proper object of punishment. We do go into the dull details; we do 
enquire into the origins; we do emphatically enquire who it was that hit
 first. In short we do what I have done very briefly in this place.</p></blockquote><p>-- G. K. Chesterton, "The Appetite of Tyranny", arguing against <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/yp/pretending_to_be_wise/">pretending to be wise</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The inhabitants of Florence in 1494 or Athens in 404 BCE 
could be forgiven for concluding that optimism just isn't factually 
true. For they knew nothing of such things as the reach of explanations 
or the power of science or even laws of nature as we understand them, 
let alone the moral and technological progress that was to follow when <em>the</em>
 Enlightenment got under way. At the moment of defeat, it must have 
seemed at least plausible to the formerly optimistic Athenians that the 
Spartans might be right, and to the formerly optimistic Florentines that
 Savonarola might be. Like every other destruction of optimism, whether 
in a whole civilization or in a single individual, these must have been 
unspeakable catastrophes for those who had dared to expect progress. But
 we should feel more than sympathy for those people. We should take it 
personally. For if any of those earlier experiments in optimism had 
succeeded, our species would be exploring the stars by now, and you and I
 would be immortal.</p></blockquote><p>David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity</p>

<blockquote><p>Stepan Arkadyevitch subscribed to a liberal paper, and 
read it. It was not extreme in those views, but advocated those 
principles the majority held. And though he was not really interested in
 science or art or politics, he strongly adhered to such views on all 
those subjects as the majority, including his paper, advocated, and he 
changed them only when the majority changed them; or more correctly, he 
did not change them, but they themselves imperceptibly changed in him.</p><p>Stepan
 Arkadyevitch never chose principles or opinions, but these principles 
and opinions came to him, just as he never chose the shape of a hat or 
coat, but took those that others wore. And, living as he did in 
fashionable society, through the necessity of some mental activity, 
developing generally in a man's best years, it was as indispensable for 
him to have views as to have a hat. If there was any reason why he 
preferred liberal views rather than the conservative direction which 
many of his circle followed, it was not because he found a liberal 
tendency more rational, but because he found it better suited to his 
mode of life.</p><p>The liberal party declared that everything in Russia
 was wretched; and the fact was that Stepan Arkadyevitch had a good many
 debts and was decidedly short of money. The liberal party said that 
marriage was a defunct institution and that it needed to be remodeled, 
and in fact domestic life afforded Stepan Arakadyevitch very little 
pleasure, and compelled him to lie, and to pretend, which was contrary 
to his nature. The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be 
understood, that religion is only a curb on the barbarous portion of the
 community, and in fact Stepan Arkadyevitch could not bear the shortest 
prayer without pain in his knees, and he could not comprehend the 
necessity of all these high-sounding words about the other world when it
 was so very pleasant to live in this one.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Leo Tolstoy, <em>Anna Karenina</em></li></ul><p>The personal is political!</p>

<p>I've linked to a quote from <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/02/daniel-ellsberg-limitations-knowledge" rel="nofollow">Daniel Ellsberg</a> at Overcoming Bias, but it seemed relevant enough here to excerpt the bits that caught my eye:</p>

<p>First, you'll be exhilarated by some of this new information, and by 
having it all — so much! incredible! — suddenly available to you. But 
second, almost as fast, you will feel like a fool for having studied, 
written, talked about these subjects, criticized and analyzed decisions 
made by presidents for years without having known of the existence of 
all this information, which presidents and others had and you didn't, 
and which must have influenced their decisions in ways you couldn't even
 guess</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>you will forget there ever was a time when you didn't have it, and 
you'll be aware only of the fact that you have it now and most others 
don't....and that all those other people are fools</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>you'll eventually become aware of the limitations of this information
 [...] But that takes a while to learn.
In the meantime it will have become very hard for you to learn from 
anybody who doesn't have these clearances. Because you'll be thinking as
 you listen to them: 'What would this man be telling me if he knew what I
 know? Would he be giving me the same advice, or would it totally change
 his predictions and recommendations?' And that mental exercise is so 
torturous that after a while you give it up and just stop listening.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>You will deal with a person who doesn't have those clearances only 
from the point of view of what you want him to believe and what 
impression you want him to go away with, since you'll have to lie 
carefully to him about what you know. In effect, you will have to 
manipulate him. You'll give up trying to assess what he has to say. The 
danger is, you'll become something like a moron. You'll become incapable
 of learning from most people in the world, no matter how much 
experience they may have in their particular areas that may be much 
greater than yours.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was halfway through my Ph.D. I formulated a hypothesis: The 
proximate challenge that keeps you from graduating is that you have to 
write a thesis. But the ultimate challenge to getting your Ph.D. is 
this: You somehow have to learn to understand, deep down, that all your 
romantic notions about the Ph.D. are bunk, that you will be exactly the 
same person on the day after you get it that you were the day before, 
and that you need to stop waiting for the day when you feel like a god 
and just write something down and get on with life.</p>
  
  <p>It may take you years to accept this, and it may drive you to drink, but after you get to that point you can graduate.</p>
  
  <p>Only then will you be able to live with the fact that your thesis 
looks like crap to you. Your thesis will always look like crap to you. 
Either you will have figured out absolutely everything and your thesis 
will look incredibly boring to you, because you've moved on, or -- 
vastly more likely -- your thesis will look woefully incomplete because,
 geez, there is so much that you couldn't figure out, and you're just so
 stupid!</p>
  
  <p>Or, most likely of all, you will think both of these things at the same time.</p>
  
  <p>Similarly: <strong>Being the world's foremost expert on a 
particular scientific problem is a lot less exciting in real life than 
it seems in the movies. In fact, being on the frontier of science feels 
like being totally, hopelessly lost and confused. Why this came as a 
surprise to me I'll never know.</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to 
them.  When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and 
then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualizing you 
probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit it. 
 When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words
 from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, 
the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the
 expense of blurring or even changing your meaning.  Probably it is 
better to put off using words as long as possible and get one's meaning 
as clear as one can through pictures and sensations.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Consider an instance close to hand: arguments on the Internet. 
Whether the discussion is about abortion or the definition of atheism or
 the advisability of tax cuts, one might think that the longer the

the case. A couple of scientists discussing the proper taxonomy of flesh

  <p>Expert estimates of probability are often off by factors of

error was high in a forecasting model that I might put together. Now I 
view it as perhaps the single most important piece of information that a
 forecaster provides. When we publish a forecast on FiveThirtyEight, I 
go to great lengths to document the uncertainty attached to it, even if 
the uncertainty is sufficiently large that the forecast won’t make for

  <p>In the early 1970's it cost $7 to buy a share in [Warren Buffett's]
 company, and that same share is worth $4,900 today... That makes 
Buffett a wonderful investor. What makes him the greatest investor of 
all time is that during a certain period when he thought stocks were 
grossly overpriced, he sold everything and returned all the money to his
 partners at a sizable profit to them. The voluntary returning of money 
that others would gladly pay you to continue to manage is, in my

<blockquote><p>Some environments are worse than irregular. Robin Hogarth
 described "wicked" environments, in which professionals are likely to 
learn the wrong lessons from experience. He borrows from Lewis Thomas 
the example of a physician in the early twentieth century who often had 
intuitions about patients who were about to develop typhoid. 
Unfortunately, he tested his hunch by palpating the patient's tongue, 
without washing his hands between patients. When patient after patient 
became ill, the physician developed a sense of clinical infallibility. 
His predictions were accurate--but not because he was exercising 
professional intuition!</p></blockquote><p>--Daniel Kahneman in <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></p>

<blockquote><p>The reason you can't rigidly separate positive from 
normative economics is that you can't rigidly separate claims of fact 
from claims of value in general. Human language is too laden with thick 
concepts that mix the two. The claim that someone is a "slut" or a 
"bitch", for example, melds together factual claims about a woman's 
behavior with a lot of deeply embedded normative concepts about what 
constitutes appropriate behavior for a woman. The claim that financial 
markets are "efficient" is both an effort to describe their operation 
and a way of valorizing them. The idea of a "recession" or "full 
employment" or "potential output" all embed certain ideas about what 
would constitute a normal arrangement of human economic activity (...) 
You could try to rigorously purge your descriptions of the economy of 
anything that vaguely smells of a thick moral concept, but you'd find 
yourself operating with an impoverished vocubulary unable to describe 
human affairs in any kind of reasonable way.</p></blockquote><p>--<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/03/01/the_positive_normative_distinction_in_economics_is_nonsense_but_it_doesn_t_really_matter.html" rel="nofollow">Matt Yglesias</a></p>

<blockquote><p>[Hitler] has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic 
attitude to life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, 
certainly all "progressive" thought, has assumed tacitly that human 
beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In 
such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and 
the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with 
soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute
 for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, because 
in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows 
that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, 
hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at 
least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention 
drums, flag and loyalty-parades.</p><p>However they may be as economic 
theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any 
hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s 
militarized version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have 
enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. 
Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to 
people "I offer you a good time," Hitler has said to them "I offer you 
struggle, danger and death," and as a result a whole nation flings 
itself at his feet.</p></blockquote><p>(George Orwell's review of Mein Kampf)</p><p>(well, we have videogames now, yet... we gotta make them better! more vicseral!)</p>

man. "You're wrong, of course. There are, always and only, the bad people, but some of them are on opposite sides. "</p><p>He waved his thin hand towards the city and walked over to the window.</p><p>"A
 great rolling sea of evil," he said, almost proprietorially. "Shallower
 in some places, of course, but deeper, oh,
so much deeper in others. But people like you put together little rafts 
of rules and vaguely good intentions and say, this is the opposite, this
 will triumph in the end. Amazing!" He slapped Vimes good-naturedly on 
the back.</p><p>"Down there," he said, "are people who will follow any 
dragon, worship any god, ignore any iniquity. All out of a kind of 
humdrum, everyday badness. Not the really high, creative loathesomeness 
of the great sinners, but a sort of mass-produced darkness of the soul. 
Sin, you might say, without a trace of originality. They accept evil not
 because they say yes, but because they don't say no. I'm sorry if this 
offends you,'' he added, patting the captain's shoulder, "but you 
fellows really need us."</p><p>"Yes, sir?" said Vimes quietly.</p><p>"Oh,
 yes. We're the only ones who know how to make things work. You see, the
 only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the bad people. 
And you're good at that, I'll grant you. But the trouble is that it's 
the only thing you're good at. One day it's the ringing of the bells and
 the casting down of the evil tyrant, and the next it's everyone sitting
 around complaining that ever since the tyrant was overthrown no-one's 
been taking out the trash. Because the bad people know how to plan. It's
 part of the specification, you might say. Every evil tyrant has a plan 
to rule the world. The good people don't seem to have the knack."</p><p>"Maybe.
 But you're wrong about the rest!" said Vimes. "It's just because people
 are afraid, and alone-" He paused. It sounded pretty hollow, even to 
him.</p><p>He shrugged. "They're just people," he said. "They're just doing what people do. Sir."</p><p>Lord
 Vetinari gave him a friendly smile. "Of course, of course," he said. 
"You have to believe that, I appreciate. Otherwise you'd go quite mad. 
Otherwise you'd think you're standing on a feather-thin bridge over the 
vaults of Hell. Otherwise existence would be a dark agony and the only 
hope would be that there is no life after death. I quite understand."</p><p>(...)</p><p>After a while he made a few pencil annotations to the paper in front of him and looked up.</p><p>"I said," he said, "that you may go."</p><p>Vimes paused at the door.</p><p>"Do you believe all that, sir?" he said. "About the endless evil and the sheer blackness?"</p><p>"Indeed, indeed," said the Patrician, turning over the page. "It is the only logical conclusion."</p><p>"But you get out of bed every morning, sir?"</p><p>"Hmm? Yes? What is your point?"</p><p>"I'd just like to know why, sir."</p><p>"Oh, do go away, Vimes. There's a good fellow."</p></blockquote><p>-- Terry Pratchett, "Guards! Guards!"</p><p>I
 really like the character of Lord Vetinari. He's like a more successful
 version of Quirrell from HPMOR who decided that it's okay to have 
cynical beliefs but idealistic aims.</p>

<blockquote><p>A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice

 terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and

<p>Long quote to make a simple point, but relevant. (Context: this is from a Star Wars novel, so it's fiction.)</p><blockquote><p>A death hollow is a low point where the heavier-than-air toxic gases that roll downslope from the volcanoes can pool.</p><p>The
 corpse of a hundred-kilo tusker lay just within its rim, its snout only
 a meter below the clear air that could have saved it. Other corpses 
littered the ground around it: rot crows and jacunas and other small 
scavengers I didn't recognize, lured to their deaths by the jungle's 
false promise of an easy meal.</p><p>I said something along these lines to Nick. He laughed and called me a Balawai fool.</p><p>"There's no false promise," he'd said. "There's no promise at all. The jungle doesn't <em>promise</em>. It exists. That's all. What killed those little ruskakks wasn't a trap. It was just the way things are."</p><p>Nick
 says that to talk of the jungle as a person-to give it the metaphoric 
aspect of a creature, any creature-that's a Balawai thing. That's part 
of what gets them killed out here.</p><p>It's a metaphor that shades the way you think: talk of the jungle as a creature, and you start <em>treating</em>
 it like a creature. You start thinking you can outsmart the jungle, or 
trust it, overpower it or befriend it, deceive it or bargain with it.</p><p>And then you die.</p><p>"Not because the jungle kills you. You get it? Just because <em>it is what it is</em>." These are Nick's words. "The jungle doesn't <em>do</em> anything. It's just a place. It's a place where many, many things live... and <em>all of them die</em>.
 Fantasizing about it - pretending it's something it's not - is fatal. 
That's your free life lesson for the day," he told me. "Keep it in 
mind."</p><p>I will.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Mace Windu, in <em>Shatterpoint</em> by Matthew Stover</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>It is very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if the cat is not there.</p></blockquote><p>— Confucius, allegedly (quoted in <em>The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed</em>)</p><p><em>Edit:</em>
 The rationality relevance might need some explanation. The way I've 
seen this aphorism used is this: it's sometimes hard to distinguish 
between a task that's achievable but very difficult (and that it 
therefore might make sense to spend time/effort on), and a task that is 
impossible (and thus is a complete waste of time/effort).</p><p>If you 
spend some time searching for the cat in the dark room, you might not 
find it. Is that because finding it is difficult (after all, this is 
what you might quite plausibly expect, if you assume that the cat is 
there), or because the cat is not there and you're wasting your time?</p>

<blockquote><p>But if the question is "Has this caused you to revise 
downward your estimate of the value of health insurance?" the answer has
 to obviously be yes. Anyone who answers differently is looking deep 
into their intestinal loops, not the Oregon study. You don't have to 
revise the estimate to zero, or even a low number. But if you'd asked 
folks before the results dropped what we'd expect to see if insurance 
made people a lot healthier, they'd have said "statistically significant
 improvement on basic markers for the most common chronic diseases. The 
fact that we didn't see that means that we should now say that health 
insurance, or at least Medicaid, probably doesn't make as big a 
difference in health as we thought.</p></blockquote><p>-- Megan McArdle, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/03/how-the-oregon-study-should-change-our-thinking.html" rel="nofollow">trying to explain</a> Bayesian updates and the importance of making predictions in advance, without referring to any mathematics.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Oh, you could do it all by magic, you certainly could. 
You could wave a wand and get twinkly stars and a fresh-baked loaf. You 
could make fish jump out of the sea already cooked. And then, somewhere,
 somehow, magic would present its bill, which was always more than you 
could afford.</p><p>That’s why it was left to wizards, who knew how to 
handle it safely. Not doing any magic at all was the chief task of 
wizards - not “not doing magic” because they <em>couldn’t</em> do magic,
 but not doing magic when they could do and didn’t. Any ignorant fool 
can fail to turn someone else into a frog. You have to be clever to 
refrain from doing it when you knew how easy it was.</p><p>There were 
places in the world commemorating those times when wizards hadn’t been 
quite as clever as that, and on many of them the grass would never grow 
again."</p></blockquote><p>-- Terry Prachett, Going Postal</p>

<blockquote><p>From Jacques Vallee, Messengers of Deception...</p></blockquote><p>'Then
 he posed a question that, obvious as it seems, had not really occurred 
to me: “What makes you think that UFOs are a scientific problem?”</p><p>I
 replied with something to the effect that a problem was only scientific
 in the way it was approached, but he would have none of that, and he 
began lecturing me. First, he said, science had certain rules. For 
example, <strong>it has to assume that the phenomena it is observing is natural in origin rather than artificial and possibly biased.</strong> Now the UFO phenomenon could be controlled by alien beings. “If it is,” added the Major, <strong>“then the study of it doesn’t belong to science. It belongs to Intelligence.”</strong> Meaning counterespionage. And that, he pointed out, was his domain. *</p><p>“Now, in the field of counterespionage, the rules are completely different.” He drew a simple diagram in my notebook. <strong>“You
 are a scientist. In science there is no concept of the ‘price’ of 
information. Suppose I gave you 95 per cent of the data concerning a 
phenomenon. You’re happy because you know 95 per cent of the phenomenon.
 Not so in intelligence. If I get 95 per cent of the data, I know that 
this is the ‘cheap’ part of the information. I still need the other 5 
percent, but I will have to pay a much higher price to get it.</strong> You see, Hitler had 95 per cent of the information about the landing in Normandy. But he had the wrong 95 percent!”</p><p>“Are
 you saying that the UFO data we us to compile statistics and to find 
patterns with computers are useless?” I asked. “Might we be spinning our
 magnetic tapes endlessly discovering spurious laws?”</p><p>“It all 
depends on how the team on the other side thinks. If they know what 
they’re doing, there will be so many cutouts between you and them that 
you won’t have the slightest chance of tracing your way to the truth. 
Not by following up sightings and throwing them into a computer. They 
will keep feeding you the information they want you to process. What is 
the only source of data about the UFO phenomenon? It is the UFOs 
themselves!”</p><p>Some things were beginning to make a lot of sense. 
“If you’re right, what can I do? It seems that research on the 
phenomenon is hopeless, then. I might as well dump my computer into a 
river.”</p><p>“Not necessarily, but you should try a different approach.
 First you should work entirely outside of the organized UFO groups; 
they are infiltrated by the same official agencies they are trying to 
influence, and they propagate any rumour anyone wants to have 
circulated. In Intelligence circles, people like that are historical 
necessities. We call them ‘useful idiots’. When you’ve worked long 
enough for Uncle Sam, you know he is involved in a lot of strange 
things. The data these groups get is biased at the source, but they play
 a useful role.</p><p><strong>“Second, you should look for the 
irrational, the bizarre, the elements that do not fit...Have you ever 
felt that you were getting close to something that didn’t seem to fit 
any rational pattern yet gave you a strong impression that it was 
significant?”'</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>IF you can keep your head when all about you <br><br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br><br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br><br>
But make allowance for their doubting too; <br><br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br><br>
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, <br><br>
Or being hated, don't give way to hating, <br><br>
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:</p><p>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; <br><br>
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; <br><br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br><br>
And treat those two impostors just the same; <br><br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken <br><br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br><br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br><br>
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:</p><p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br><br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br><br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br><br>
And never breathe a word about your loss; <br><br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br><br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br><br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br><br>
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'</p><p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br><br>
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch, <br><br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br><br>
If all men count with you, but none too much; <br><br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br><br>
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, <br><br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, <br><br>
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!</p></blockquote><p>If--, by Rudyard Kipling</p>

<blockquote><p>The theme of this book, then, must be the <em>coming to consciousness</em>
 of uncertain inference. The topic may be compared to, say, the history 
of visual perspective. Everyone can see in perspective, but it has been a
 difficult and long-drawn-out effort of humankind to become aware of the
 principles of perspective in order to take advantage of them and 
imitate nature. So it is with probability. Everyone can act so as to 
take a rough account of risk, but understanding the principles of 
probability and using them to improve performance is an immense task.</p></blockquote><p>James Franklin, <em>The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moral language persuades best when opinions are not yet formed, 
which is why writers of children’s literature can get away with saying 
things like, “Mr. Billings was an awful, horrible man with a heart of 
stone.”  This sounds like a line from a children’s book because it 
employs persuasive methods that, though appropriate for children, would 
insult the intelligence of most adult readers.</p>
  
  <p>Most moral discourse is the conversational equivalent of children’s
 literature.  Disputants speak to one another—or, rather, at one 
another—as if their interlocutors failed to pay adequate attention on 
the day elementary morality was explained.  Unaware of the projective 
nature of value, they marvel at their opponents’ blindness, their utter 
failure to see what is so perfectly obvious.  Not knowing what else to 
do, they scold their opponents as if they were children, and scold them 
as if they were <em>belligerent</em> children when they fail to respond the first time.</p>
  
  <p>What to do about this?  Take a cue from good writers.  Stick to the
 facts.  Keep evaluative language to a minimum, and get rid of the most 
overtly judgmental, moralistic language.</p></blockquote>

  <p>I recall, for example, suggesting to a regular loser at a weekly 
poker game that he keep a record of his winnings and losses. His 
response was that he used to do so but had given up because it proved to
 be unlucky. - Ken Binmore, <em>Rational Decisions</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A side note: All three of the quotes I've posted are from Binmore's <em>Rational Decisions</em>, which I'm about a third of the way through and have found very interesting. It makes a great companion to <em>Less Wrong</em> -- and it's also quite quotable in spots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, 
and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of 
biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that 
he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in 
the front row, if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a 
biscuit. <br><br>
  "Nice biscuit, don't you think," said Korzybski, while he took a 2nd 
one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper 
from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a
 big picture of a dog's head and the words "Dog Cookies." <br><br>
  The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them 
wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out 
of the lecture hall to the toilet. <br><br>
  "You see," Korzybski remarked, "I have just demonstrated that people 
don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is
 often outdone by the taste of the latter."'</p></blockquote>

<p>I think of this as a rationalist parable and not so much a quote. It 
has a lot of personal resonance since I often had dog biscuits with my 
tea when I was younger.</p>

<p>On the same theme as the previous one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons. First of 
all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It's 
there for me every day. And the things it brings me are quite apparent 
all the time: heat, light, food, a lovely day. There is no mystery, no 
one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there is no boring 
pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I 
offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to "God" are all 
answered at about the same 50-percent rate.</p></blockquote>

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, <br><br>
when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit <br><br>
of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our <br><br>
disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as <br><br>
if we were villains by necessity; fools by <br><br>
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and <br><br>
treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards, <br><br>
liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of <br><br>
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, <br><br>
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion <br><br>
of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish <br><br>
disposition to the charge of a star!</p>

  <p>Our headlines are splashed with crime, yet for every criminal there
 are 10,000 honest decent kindly men. If it were not so, no child would 
live to grow up, business could not go on from day to day. Decency is 
not news; it is buried in the obituaries -- but it is a force stronger 
than crime.</p></blockquote>

  <p>"The ordinary modes of human thinking are magical, religious, and 
social. We want our wishes to come true; we want the universe to care 
about us; we want the esteem of our peers. For most people, wanting to 
know the truth about the world is way, way down the list. Scientific 
objectivity is a freakish, unnatural, and unpopular mode of thought, 
restricted to small cliques whom the generality of citizens regard with 
dislike and mistrust."</p></blockquote>

 large set of labels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the

developments and consequences, and possible interventions to cure or 
mitigate the illness. Learning medicine consists in part of learning the
 language of medicine. A deeper understanding of judgments and choices

<blockquote><p>I believe I am accurate in saying that educators too are 
interested in learnings which make a difference. Simple knowledge of 
facts has its value. To know who won the battle of Poltava, or when the 
umpteenth opus of Mozart was first performed, may win $64,000 or some 
other sum for the possessor of this information, but I believe educators
 in general are a little embarrassed by the assumption that the 
acquisition of such knowledge constitutes education. Speaking of this 
reminds me of a forceful statement made by a professor of agronomy in my
 freshman year in college. Whatever knowledge I gained in his course has
 departed completely, but I remember how, with World War I as his 
background, he was comparing factual knowledge with ammunition. He wound
 up his little discourse with the exhortation, "Don't be a damned 
ammunition wagon; be a rifle!"</p></blockquote><p>-Carl Rogers, <em>On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View of Psychotherapy</em> (1961)</p>

Africa," it disappears as soon as we discover it.</p></blockquote><p>-- Marvin Minsky, <em>The Society of Mind</em></p>

<blockquote><p>"Because they were hypocrites," Finkle-McGraw said, after
 igniting his calabash and shooting a few tremendous fountains of smoke 
into the air, "the Victorians were despised in the late twentieth 
century. Many of the persons who held such opinions were, of course, 
guilty of the most nefandous conduct themselves, and yet saw no paradox 
in holding such views because they were not hypocrites themselves-they 
took no moral stances and lived by none."</p><p>"So they were morally 
superior to the Victorians-" Major Napier said, still a bit snowed 
under. "-even though-in fact, because-they had no morals at all." There 
was a moment of silent, bewildered head-shaking around the copper table.</p><p>"We
 take a somewhat different view of hypocrisy," Finkle-McGraw continued. 
"In the late-twentieth-century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite was someone 
who espoused high moral views as part of a planned campaign of 
deception-he never held these beliefs sincerely and routinely violated 
them in privacy. Of course, most hypocrites are not like that. Most of 
the time it's a spirit-is-willing, flesh-is-weak sort of thing."</p><p>"That
 we occasionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier said, 
working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in espousing 
that code."</p><p>"Of course not," Finkle-McGraw said. "It's perfectly 
obvious, really. No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict 
code of conduct. Really, the difficulties involved-the missteps we make 
along the way are what make it interesting. The internal, and eternal, 
struggle, between our base impulses and the rigorous demands of our own 
moral system is quintessentially human. It is how we conduct ourselves 
in that struggle that determines how we may in time be judged by a 
higher power."</p></blockquote><p>— Neal Stephenson, <em>The Diamond Age</em></p>

<blockquote><p>In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the 
Lower Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles. 
That is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year. 
Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic, can see that in
 the Old Oolitic Silurian Period, just a million years ago next 
November, the Lower Mississippi River was upwards of one million three 
hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a
 fishing-rod. And by the same token any person can see that seven 
hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a
 mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have 
joined their streets together, and be plodding comfortably along under a
 single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. There is something 
fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture
 out of such a trifling investment of fact.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Mark Twain - Life on the Mississippi</li></ul><p>(If
 you wonder where "two hundred and forty-two miles" shortening of the 
river came from, it was the straightening of its original meandering

<blockquote><p>Then for the first time it dawned on him that classing 
all drowthers together made no more sense than having a word for all 
animals that can't stand upright on two legs for more than a minute, or 
all animals with dry noses. What possible use could there be for such 
classifications? The word "drowther" didn't say anything about people 
except that they were not born in a Westil Family. "Drowther" meant "not
 us," and anything you said about drowthers beyond that was likely to be
 completely meaningless. They were not a "class" at all. They were 
just... people.</p></blockquote><p>Orson Scott Card, <em>The Lost Gate</em></p>

<blockquote><p>It is said, for example, that a man ten times regrets 
having spoken, for the once he regrets his silence. And why? Because the
 fact of having spoken is an external fact, which may involve one in 
annoyances, since it is an actuality. But the fact of having kept 
silent! Yet this is the most dangerous thing of all. For by keeping 
silent one is relegated solely to oneself, no actuality comes to a man's
 aid by punishing him, by bringing down upon him the consequences of his
 speech. No, in this respect, to be silent is the easy way. But he who 
knows what the dreadful is, must for this very reason be most fearful of
 every fault, of every sin, which takes an inward direction and leaves 
no outward trace. So it is too that in the eyes of the world it is 
dangerous to venture. And why? Because one may lose. But not to venture 
is shrewd. And yet, by not venturing, it is so dreadfully easy to lose 
that which it would be difficult to lose in even the most venturesome 
venture, and in any case never so easily, so completely as if it were 
nothing...one's self. For if I have ventured amiss--very well, then life
 helps me by its punishment. But if I have not ventured at all--who then
 helps me?</p></blockquote><p>--Soren Kierkegaard, <em>The Sickness Unto Death</em></p>

<blockquote><p>If (as those of us who make a study of ourselves have 
been led to do) each man, on hearing a wise maxim immediately looked to 
see how it properly applied to him, he would find that it was not so 
much a pithy saying as a whiplash applied to the habitual stupidity of 
his faculty of judgment. But the counsels of Truth and her precepts are 
taken to apply to the generality of men, never to oneself; we store them
 up in our memory not in our manners, which is most stupid and 
unprofitable.</p></blockquote><p>Michel de Montaigne, <em>Essays</em>, "On habit"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once again, we are saddled with a Stone Age moral psychology that 
is appropriate to life in small, homogeneous communities in which all 
members share roughly the same moral outlook. Our minds trick us into 
thinking that <strong>we</strong> are <strong>absolutely right</strong> and that <strong>they</strong> are <strong>absolutely wrong</strong>
 because, once upon a time, this was a useful way to think. It is no 
more, though it remains natural as ever. We love our respective moral 
senses. They are as much a part of us as anything. But if we are to live
 together in the world we have created for ourselves, so unlike the one 
in which our ancestors evolved, we must know when to trust our moral 
senses and when to ignore them.</p>

they wanted to be these things and were almost entirely blind to the 
fact that others wanted the same. Intentions were all important when it 
came to self-judgement, and pretty much irrelevant when it came to 
judging others. The only exceptions, it turned out, were loved ones.</p>

<p>"In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, 
there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably
 be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution 
or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected 
across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and 
says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the 
more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't 
see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and 
think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use 
of it, I may allow you to destroy it." GK Chesterton</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Idealists of all schools, aristocrats and bourgeois, theologians 
and physicians, politicians and moralists, religionists, philosophers, 
or poets, not forgetting the liberal economists - unbounded worshippers 
of the ideal, as we know - are much offended when told that man, with 
his magnificent intelligence, his sublime ideas, and his boundless 
aspirations, is, like all else existing in the world, nothing but 
matter, only a product of vile matter.</p>
  
  <p>We may answer that the matter of which materialists speak, matter 
spontaneously and eternally mobile, active, productive, matter 
chemically or organically determined and manifested by the properties or
 forces, mechanical, physical, animal, and intelligent, which 
necessarily belong to it - that this matter has nothing in common with 
the vile matter of the idealists. The latter, a product of their false 
abstraction, is indeed a stupid, inanimate, immobile thing, incapable of
 giving birth to the smallest product, a caput mortuum, an ugly fancy in
 contrast to the beautiful fancy which they call God; as the opposite of
 this supreme being, matter, their matter, stripped by that constitutes 
its real nature, necessarily represents supreme nothingness.</p></blockquote>

 where you don't even bother asking questions that won't make you update
 your probability estimates significantly. Then I remembered that Norvig

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintersmith" rel="nofollow">Wintersmith</a>, on the ability to notice confusion rather than rationalizing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"And now I shall tell you something vitally important. It is the secret of my long life.”</p>
  
  <p>Ah, thought Tiffany, and she leaned forward.</p>
  
  <p>“The important thing,” said Miss Treason, “is to stay the passage 
of the wind. You should avoid rumbustious fruits and vegetables. Beans 
are the worst, take it from me.”</p>
  
  <p>“I don’t think I understand—” Tiffany began.</p>
  
  <p>“Try not to fart, in a nutshell.”</p>
  
  <p>“In a nutshell I imagine it would be pretty unpleasant!” said Tiffany nervously. She couldn’t believe she was being told this.</p>
  
  <p>“This is no joking matter,” said Miss Treason. “The human body only
 has so much air in it. You have to make it last. One plate of beans can
 take a year off your life. I have avoided rumbustiousness all my days. I
 am an old person and that means what I say is wisdom!” She gave the 
bewildered Tiffany a stern look. “Do you understand, child?”</p>
  
  <p>Tiffany’s mind raced. Everything is a test! “No,” she said. “I’m not a child and that’s nonsense, not wisdom!”</p>
  
  <p>The stern look cracked into a smile. “Yes,” said Miss Treason. 
“Total gibberish. But you’ve got to admit it’s a corker, all the same, 
right? You definitely believed it, just for a moment? The villagers did 
last year. You should have seen the way they walked about for a few 
weeks! The strained looks on their faces quite cheered me up!"</p></blockquote>

<p>About the intersection of math and politics through the mind of a child, Bob Murphy <a href="http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2011/08/no-fooling-a-really-cute-story-based-on-infinity.html#comments" rel="nofollow">relates</a> this story about his six-year-old son Clark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clark: Daddy why can’t there be a biggest number?</p>
  
  <p>Bob: Because no matter how big a number is, there is always a bigger number.</p>
  
  <p>Clark (puzzled): Why?</p>
  
  <p>Bob: OK, let’s say a guy comes up to me and says, “Hey, I know the 
biggest number!” Then I would say, “Oh yeah, what is it?” And the guy 
would tell me, “It’s a billion billion.” But then I would just add 1 to 
it, and say, “A ha, a billion billion and 1 is a bigger number. So you 
made a mistake when you said you thought of the biggest number.”</p>
  
  <p>Clark (after a pause): What guy are you talking about?</p>
  
  <p>Bob: Just any guy. I’m saying, if anybody tries to think of the 
biggest number, I’ll always be able to do that trick–where I add 1 to 
it–so they can’t do it. They’ll always lose.</p>
  
  <p>Clark: What if a girl asks you?</p>
  
  <p>[I ran through the same thing with a girl asking me...]</p>
  
  <p>Clark: OK I want to tell the story!</p>
  
  <p>Bob: Sure go ahead.</p>
  
  <p>Clark: So what if a guy came up to me and said, “Hey Clark, I know 
the biggest number! It’s 100 billion!” Then I would say, “No, 100 
billion and 1 is bigger! You’re wrong!”</p>
  
  <p>Bob: Right, good job. So he didn’t really think of the biggest number after all, did he?</p>
  
  <p>Clark: No.</p>
  
  <p>Bob: And you can always do that.</p>
  
  <p>Clark: OK let me tell it again with Sam [name possibly changed--a kid from his class].</p>
  
  <p>Bob: OK.</p>
  
  <p>Clark: So what if Sam came up to me and said, “Hey Clark, I know 
the biggest number. It’s 50 googol.” But I would say, “No Sam you’re 
wrong! 50 googol and 1 is bigger!” But Sam gets mad so he would start 
shouting and say, “I DID TOO THINK OF THE BIGGEST NUMBER CLARK!!”</p></blockquote>

<p>And I know we're not supposed to quote ourselves, but you rarely get an opportunity to use a line like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess you already tried explaining to Clark that the cardinality 
of the natural numbers is invariant under transformations of largest 
number proponent?</p></blockquote>

  <p>Ralph Hull made a reasonable living as a magician milking a card 
trick he called "The Tuned Deck"...Hull enjoyed subjecting himself to 
the scrutiny of colleagues who attempted to eliminate, one by one, 
various explanations by depriving him of the ability to perform a 
particular sleight of hand. But the real trick was over before it had 
even begun, for the magic was not in clever fingers but in a clever 
name. The blatantly singular referent cried out for a blatantly singular
 explanation, when in reality The Tuned Deck was not one trick but many.
 The search for a single explanation is what kept this multiply 
determined illusion so long a mystery.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Writers of all stripes enjoy engaging in the most cynical readings 
of human behavior because they think it makes them appear 
hyper-rational. But in fact here is a perfect example of how trying to 
achieve that makes you irrational. Human emotion is real. It is an 
observable phenomenon. It observably influences behavior. Therefore to 
fail to account for it when discussing coupling and relationships is the
 opposite of cold rationality; it is in fact a failure of empiricism.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It’s not a good idea for members of the faith-based 
community like Hitchens to proclaim things like: Science proves we’re 
all genetically equal, so therefore you shouldn’t be beastly toward 
people of other races. The obvious flaw in this strategy is that 
eventually people will figure out that you are lying about what the 
science of genetics says, and therefore, by your own logic, that 
discredits the perfectly valid second half of your assertion.</p></blockquote><p>--Steve Sailer</p>

<blockquote><p>The word <em>problem</em> may be an insidious form of question-begging. To speak of the <em>Jewish problem</em>
 is to postulate that the Jews are a problem; it is to predict (and 
recommend) persecution, plunder, shooting, beheading, rape, and the 
reading of Dr. Rosenberg's prose. Another disadvantage of fallacious 
problems is that they bring about solutions that are equally fallacious.
 Pliny (Book VIII of <em>Natural History</em>) is not satisfied with the
 observation that dragons attack elephants in the summer; he ventures 
the hypothesis that they do it in order to drink the elephants' blood, 
which, as everyone knows, is very cold.</p></blockquote><p>-- Jorge Luis Borges, "Dr. Américo Castro is Alarmed"</p>

weapons on the dead for the same reason that we put flowers, because it

 it is true, the emotion that makes us think it is obvious and natural;

<blockquote><p>I prefer this sort of distant, reductionist, structural 
approach to analysing the race because there's little reason to believe 
in the validity of the implicit theories or "models" lurking behind 
pundits' gut judgments. When I heard Mr Romney's 47% comments, I thought
 "Oooh, he's toast!" and then I stopped myself and acknowledged that I 
actually have no rational basis for believing that his remarks would in 
the final analysis hurt Mr Romney at all. What percentage of undecided 
or weakly-decided swing-state voters ever caught wind of Mr Romney's 
embarrassing chat? I didn't know! Of those who became aware of it, how 
many cared? I didn't know! So why did I think "Oooh, he's toast!" 
Because I am human, and I make most judgments and decisions on the basis
 of crackpot hunches, the underlying logic of which is almost completely
 inscrutable to me.</p></blockquote><p>--<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/10/presidential-election" rel="nofollow">Will Wilkinson</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Despite the difficulty of exact Bayesian inference in 
complex mathematical models, the essence of Bayesian reasoning is 
frequently used in everyday life. One example has been immortalized in 
the words of Sherlock Holmes to his friend Dr. Watson: “How often have I
 said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever 
remains, however improbable, must be the truth?” (Arthur Conan Doyle, 
The Sign of Four, 1890, Ch. 6). This reasoning is actually a consequence
 of Bayesian belief updating, as expressed in Equation 4.4. Let me 
re-state it this way: “How often have I said to you that when p(D|θ_i ) =
 0 for all i!=j, then, no matter how small the prior p(θ_j )  0 is, the 
posterior p(θ_j |D) must equal one.” Somehow it sounds better the way 
Holmes said it.</p></blockquote><p>--Kruschke 2010, <em>Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</em>, pg56-57</p>

<blockquote><p>In the way that skepticism is sometimes applied to issues
 of public concern, there is a tendency to belittle, to condescend, to 
ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and 
pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the 
skeptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role
 in it might be. Their motives are in many ways consonant with science. 
If their culture has not given them all the tools they need to pursue 
this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness. None of us 
comes fully equipped.</p></blockquote><p>--Carl Sagan</p>

<blockquote><p>I once heard a story about the original writer of the 
Superman Radio Series. He wanted a pay rise, his employers didn't want 
to give him one. He decided to end the series with Superman trapped at 
the bottom of a well, tied down with kryptonite and surrounded by a 
hundred thousand tanks (or something along these lines). It was a 
cliffhanger. He then made his salary demands. His employers refused and 
went round every writer in America, but nobody could work out how the 
original writer was planning to have Superman escape. Eventually the 
radio guys had to go back to him and meet his wage demands. The first 
show of the next series began "Having escaped from the well, Superman 
hurried to..." There's a lesson in there somewhere, but I've no idea 
what it is.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://writebadlywell.blogspot.com/2010/05/write-yourself-into-corner.html" rel="nofollow">http://writebadlywell.blogspot.com/2010/05/write-yourself-into-corner.html</a></p><p>I
 would argue that the lesson is that when something valuable is at 
stake, we should focus on the simplest available solutions to the 
puzzles we face, rather than on ways to demonstrate our intelligence to 
ourselves or others.</p>

<blockquote><p>I keep coming back to the essential problem that in our 
increasingly complex society, we are actually required to hold very firm
 opinions about highly complex matters that require analysis from 
multiple fields of expertise (economics, law, political science, 
engineering, others) in hugely complex systems where we must use our 
imperfect data to choose among possible outcomes that involve 
significant trade offs. This would be OK if we did not regard everyone 
who disagreed with us as an ignorant pinhead or vile evildoer whose sole
 motivation for disagreeing is their intrinsic idiocy, greed, or hatred 
for our essential freedoms/people not like themselves. Except that there
 actually are LOTS of ignorant pinheads and vile evildoers whose sole 
motivation etc., or whose self-interest is obvious to everyone but 
themselves.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://osewalrus.livejournal.com/1078518.html" rel="nofollow">osewalrus</a></p>

<p>On consciousness:</p><blockquote><p>"Forget about minds," he told 
her. "Say you've got a device designed to monitor—oh, cosmic rays, say. 
What happens when you turn its sensor around so it's not pointing at the
 sky anymore, but at its own guts?"</p><p>He answered himself before she
 could: "It does what it's built to. It measures cosmic rays, even 
though it's not looking at them any more. It parses its own circuitry in
 terms of cosmic-ray metaphors, because those feel right, because they 
feel natural, because it can't look at things any other way. But it's 
the wrong metaphor. So the system misunderstands everything about 
itself. Maybe that's not a grand and glorious evolutionary leap after 
all. Maybe it's just a design flaw."</p></blockquote><p>-- <a href="http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm" rel="nofollow">Blindsight</a>, by Peter Watts</p>

<blockquote><p>When I was a Christian, and when I began this intense 
period of study which eventually led to my atheism, my goal, my one and 
only goal, was to find the best evidence and argument I could find that 
would lead people to the truth of Jesus Christ. That was a huge mistake.
 As a skeptic now, my goal is very similar - it just stops short. My 
goal is to find the best evidence and argument, period. Not the best 
evidence and argument that leads to a preconceived conclusion. The best

<blockquote><p>With numbers you can do anything you like. Suppose I have
 the sacred number 9 and I want to get a number 1314, date of the 
execution of Jaques de Molay - a date dear to anyone who, like me, 
professes devotion ot the Templar tradition of knighthood. What do I do?
 I multiply 9 by one hundred and forty-six, the fateful day of the 
destruction of Carthage. How did I arrive at this? I divided thirteen 
hundred and fourteen by two, three, et cetera, until I found a 
satisfying date. I could also have divided thirteen hundred and fourteen
 by 6.28, the double of 3.14 and I would have got two hundred and nine. 
That is the year Attulus I, king of Pergamon, ascended the throne. You 
see?</p></blockquote><p>Umberto Eco, <em>Foucault's Pendulum</em> (1989)</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the biggest tasks, according to Gardner, was 
tracking information and beliefs back to their roots. This is always 
important, but especially in a field as rich in hearsay as herbal 
medicine. One little piece of information, or an unsubstantiated report,
 can grow and become magnified, quickly becoming an unquestioned truism.
She used as an example the truism that the extracts of the herb Ginkgo 
Biloba might cause dangerous bleeding. Everyone says it can. The 
journalists say it. The doctors say it. The herbalists say it. Even I 
say it! It's nearly impossible to read a scientific paper on Ginkgo that
 doesn't mention this alleged danger.
But why do we say it - where did the information come from? Turns out, 
there was one case report - of a single person - who couldn't clot 
efficiently after taking Ginkgo. Another 178 papers were published that 
mentioned this danger, citing only this one report. Those 178 papers 
were cited by over 4,100 other papers. So now we have almost 
4-and-a-half thousand references in the scientific literature - not to 
mention the tens of thousands of references in the popular press - to 
the dangers of Ginkgo, all traceable back to a single person whose 
bleeding may or may not have been attributable to the herb.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://debrasnaturalgourmet.com/herbal-moments-at-expo-west" rel="nofollow">Adam Stark</a></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>you would be foolish to accept what people believed for “thousands of years” in many domains of natural science.</strong>
 When it comes to the ancients or the moderns in science always listen 
to the moderns. They are not always right, but overall they are surely 
more right, and less prone to miss the mark. In fact, you may have to be
 careful about paying too much attention to science which is a 
generation old, so fast does the “state of the art” in terms of

<blockquote><p>And anyone that’s been involved in philanthropy 
eventually comes to that point. When you try to help, you try to give 
things, you start to have the consequences. There’s an author Bob 
Lupton, who really nails it when he says that when he gave something the
 first time, there was gratitude; and when he gave something a second 
time to that same community, there was anticipation; the third time, 
there was expectation; the fourth time, there was entitlement; and the 
fifth time, there was dependency. That is what we’ve all experienced

<p>Practically anything can go faster than Disc light, which is lazy and
 tame, unlike ordinary light. The only thing known to go faster than 
ordinary light is monarchy, according to the philosopher Ly Tin Wheedle.
 He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king, and tradition
 demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the 
succession must therefore pass to the heir <em>instantaneously</em>. 
Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles—kingons, or
 possibly queons—that do this job, but of course succession sometimes 
fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon. 
His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages, involving the
 careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal, were
 never fully expounded because, at that point, the bar closed.</p>

  <p>"I'm writing a book on magic," I explain, and I'm asked, "Real 
magic?" By real magic people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and 
supernatural powers. "No," I answer. "Conjuring tricks, not real magic."</p>
  
  <p>Real magic, in other words, refers to the magic that is not real, 
while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real 
magic.</p></blockquote>

  <p>There is a mathematical style in which proofs are presented as 
strings of unmotivated tricks that miraculously do the job, but we found
 greater intellectual satisfaction in showing how each next step in the 
argument, if not actually forced, is at least something sweetly 
reasonable to try. Another reason for avoiding [pulling] rabbits [out of
 the magicians's hat] as much as possible was that we did not want to 
teach proofs, we wanted to teach proof design. Eventually, expelling 
rabbits became another joy of my professional life.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freedom is understood in contrast to its various opposites.  I can 
be free as opposed to being presently coerced.  I can be free as opposed
 to being under some other person's general control.  I can be free as 
opposed to being subject to delusions or insanity.  I can be free as 
opposed to being ruled by the state in denial of ordinary personal 
liberties.  I can be free as opposed to being in jail or prison.  I can 
be free as opposed to living under unusually heavy personal obligations.
  I can be free as opposed to being burdened by bias or prejudice.  I 
can even be free (or free spirited) as opposed to being governed by 
ordinary social conventions. The question that needs to be asked, and 
which hardly ever is asked, is whether I can be free as opposed to being
 causally determined.  Given that some kind of causal determinism is 
presupposed in the very concept of human action, it would be odd if this
 were so.  Why does anyone think that it is?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>David Hume was right to predict that superstition would survive for
 hundreds of years after his death, but how could he have anticipated 
that his own work would inspire Kant to invent a whole new package of 
superstitions?  Or that the incoherent system of Marx would move vast 
populations to engineer their own ruin?  Or that the infantile rantings 
of the author of <em>Mein Kampf</em> would be capable of bringing the whole world to war?</p>
  
  <p>Perhaps we will one day succeed in immunizing our societies against
 such bouts of collective idiocy by establishing a social contract in 
which each child is systematically instructed in Humean skepticism.  
Such a new Emile would learn about the psychological weaknesses to which
 <em>Homo sapiens</em> is prey, and so would understand the wisdom of 
treating all authorities - political leaders and social role-models, 
academics and teachers, philosophers and prophets, poets and pop stars -
 as so many potential rogues and knoves, each out to exploit the 
universal human hunger for social status.  He would therefore appreciate
 the necessity of doing all of his own thinking for himself.  He would 
understand why and when to trust his neighbors.  Above all, he would 
waste no time yearning for utopias that are incompatible with human 
nature.</p></blockquote>

<p>BTW, there's quite a bit of rationality (and irrationality) on that

 looking for women), from way back when. I don't know if 1996 predates

  <p>The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke remarked that "any 
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". 
Clarke was referring to the fantastic inventions we might discover in 
the future or in our travels to advanced civilizations. However, the 
insight also applies to self-perception. When we turn our attention to 
our own minds, we are faced with trying to understand an unimaginably 
advanced technology. We can't possibly know (let alone keep track of) 
the tremendous number of mechanical influences on our behavior because 
we inhabit an extraordinarily complicated machine. So we develop a 
shorthand, a belief in the causal efficacy of our conscious thoughts. We
 believe in the magic of our own causal agency.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“The general method that Wittgenstein does suggest is 
that of ’shewing that a man has supplied no meaning for certain signs in
 his sentences’.</p><p>I can illustrate the method from Wittgenstein’s 
later way of discussing problems. He once greeted me with the question: 
‘Why do people say that it was natural to think that the sun went round 
the earth rather than that the earth turned on its axis? I replied: ‘I 
suppose, because it looked as if the sun went round the earth.’ ‘Well,’ 
he asked, ‘what would it have looked like if it had <em>looked</em> as if the earth turned on its axis?’</p><p>This
 question brought it out that I had hitherto given no relevant meaning 
to ‘it looks as if’ in ‘it looks as if the sun goes round the earth’.</p><p>My
 reply was to hold out my hands with the palms upward, and raise them 
from my knees in a circular sweep, at the same time leaning backwards 
and assuming a dizzy expression. ‘Exactly!’ he said.”</p></blockquote><p>–Elizabeth Anscombe, <em><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/introductiontowi009827mbp" rel="nofollow">An Introduction To Wittgenstein’s Tractatus</a></em> (1959); apropos of a recent <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=12317" rel="nofollow">Scot Sumner blog post</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The demons told me that there is a hell for the 
sentimental and the pedantic. They are abandoned in an endless palace, 
more empty than full, and windowless. The condemned walk about as if 
searching for something, and, as we might expect, they soon begin to say
 that the greatest torment consists in not participating in the vision 
of God, that moral suffering is worse than physical suffering, and so 
on. Then the demons hurl them into the sea of fire, from where no one 
will ever take them out.</p></blockquote><p>Adolfo Bioy Casares (my translation)</p>

<blockquote><p>I know a lot of scientists as well as laymen are scornful
 of philosophy - perhaps understandably so. Reading academic philosophy 
journals often makes my heart sink too. But without exception, we all 
share philosophical background assumptions and presuppositions. The 
penalty of _not _ doing philosophy isn't to transcend it, but simply to 
give bad philosophical arguments a free pass.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/r7dui/david_pearce_ama/c43jfmk" rel="nofollow">David Pearce</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"Buddhism IS different. It's the followers who aren’t."</p><p>-- <a href="http://postmasculine.com/a-dust-over-india" rel="nofollow">A Dust Over India.</a></p></blockquote><p>Commentary: Reading this made me realize that many religions genuinely <em>are</em>
 different from each other. Christianity is genuinely different from 
Judaism, Islam is genuinely different from Christianity, Hinduism is 
genuinely different from all three. It's religious people who are the 
same everywhere; not the same as each other, obviously, but drawn from 
the same distribution. Is this true of atheistic humanists? Of 
transhumanists? Could you devise an experiment to test whether it was 
so, would you bet on the results of that experiment? Will they say the 
same of LessWrongers, someday? And if so, what's the point?</p><p>Now 
that I think on it, though, there might be a case for scientists being 
drawn from a different distribution, or computer programmers, or for 
that matter science fiction fans (are those all the same distributions 
as each other, I wonder?). It's not really hopeless.</p>

<blockquote><p>When we were first drawn together as a society, it had 
pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines,
 which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others, which we 
had esteemed errors, were real truths. From time to time He has been 
pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been 
improving, and our errors diminishing.</p><p>Now we are not sure that we
 are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of 
spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once 
print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and 
confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive farther improvement,
 and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders 
and founders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed 
from.</p></blockquote><p>Michael Welfare, quoted in <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/Fra2Aut.html" rel="nofollow">The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Slogans like “practice random acts of kindness” feel good
 and are easy to put into practice. But if we don’t take our activism 
more seriously than that, our motive is probably a desire to feel good 
about ourselves, to help ourselves or those close to us, or to act out 
our self-identity. The endpoint of authentic compassion is a desire to 
do the most good that one can, to be as effective as possible in 
creating a world with less suffering and destruction and more joy. 
Figuring out how we can do the most good takes careful thought over a 
long period of time, and it means moving into new and possibly 
uncomfortable areas of advocacy. But the importance of taking our 
activism seriously and approaching it from this utilitarian perspective 
cannot be overstated. It will mean a difference between life and death, 
between happiness and suffering, for thousands of people, for thousands 
of acres of the ecosystem, and for tens of thousands of animals.</p></blockquote><p>Nick Cooney, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Change-Heart-Psychology-Spreading-Social/dp/159056233X/" rel="nofollow">Change of Heart</a></em></p>

Philahue (of The Don Philahue Show) invited a member of Realists 
Anonymous to bare his soul on television. After a brief introduction 
documenting the spread of realism, Philahue turned to his guest:</p><p>DP: What kinds of realism were you into, Hilary?</p><p>H: The whole bag, Don. I was a realist about logical terms, abstract entities, theoretical postulates - you name it.</p><p>DP: And causality, what about causality?</p><p>H: That too, Don. (Audience gasps.)</p><p>DP: I'm going to press you here, Hilary. Did you at any time accept moral realism?</p><p>H: (staring at feet): Yes.</p><p>DP: What effect did all this realism have on your life?</p><p>H:
 I would spend hours aimlessly wandering the streets, kicking large 
stones and shouting, "I refute you thus!" It's embarrassing to recall.</p><p>DP: There was worse, wasn't there Hilary?</p><p>H:
 I can't deny it, don. (Audience gasps.) Instead of going to work I 
would sit at home fondling ashtrays and reading voraciously about 
converging scientific theories. I kept a copy of "Hitler: A Study in 
Tyranny" hidden in the icebox, and when no one was around I would take 
it our and chant "The Nazis were bad. The Nazis were <strong>really</strong> bad."</p></blockquote><p>-- A dialogue by Philip Gasper</p>

<blockquote><p>Do not read written works and think, "This is the Way." 
Written works are like the gate to approach the Way. Thus, there are

<blockquote><p>When you have run the length of various practices and 
none of those practices remain in your mind, that very lack of mind 
itself is the heart of "all things." When you have exhaustively learned 
the various practices and techniques and made great effort in 
disciplined training, there will be action in your arms, legs, and body 
but none in your mind; you will have distanced yourself from training, 
but will not be in opposition to it, and you will have freedom in 
whatever techniques you perform. You yourself will be unaware of where 
your mind is, and neither demons nor heresies will be able to find it.</p></blockquote><p>— Yagyū Munenori, <em>The Life-Giving Sword</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Karl Popper used to begin his lecture course on the 
philosophy of science by asking the students simply to 'observe'. Then 
he would wait in silence for one of them to ask <em>what</em> they were 
supposed to observe. [...] So he would explain to them that scientific 
observation is impossible without pre-existing knowledge about what to 
look at, what to look for, how to look, and how to interpret what one 
sees. And he would explain that, therefore, theory has to come first. It
 has to be conjectured, not derived.</p></blockquote><p>David Deutsch, <em>The Beginning of Infinity</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Foundations matter. Always and forever. Regardless of 
domain. Even if you meticulously plug all abstraction leaks, the 
lowest-level concepts on which a system is built will mercilessly limit 
the heights to which its high-level “payload” can rise. For it is the 
bedrock abstractions of a system which create its overall flavor. They 
are the ultimate constraints on the range of thinkable thoughts for 
designer and user alike. Ideas which flow naturally out of the bedrock 
abstractions will be thought of as trivial, and will be deemed useful 
and necessary. Those which do not will be dismissed as impractical 
frills — or will vanish from the intellectual landscape entirely. Line 
by line, the electronic shanty town grows. Mere difficulties harden into
 hard limits. The merely arduous turns into the impossible, and then 
finally into the unthinkable.</p><p>[...]</p><p>The ancient Romans could
 not know that their number system got in the way of developing 
reasonably efficient methods of arithmetic calculation, and they knew 
nothing of the kind of technological paths (i.e. deep-water navigation) 
which were thus closed to them.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Stanislav <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=448" rel="nofollow">http://www.loper-os.org/?p=448</a></li></ul>

<blockquote><p>Somebody could give me this glass of water and tell me

might actually have a real case that this might not be water. Now most 
cases when something like a liquid is in a cup it’s water.</p><p>A good 
way to find out if it’s water is to test if it has two hydrogens per 
oxygen in each molecule in the glass and you can test that. If it 
evaporates like water, if it tastes like water, freezes like water… the 
more tests we apply, the more sure we can be that it’s water.</p><p>However,
 if it were some kind of acid and we started to test and we found that 
the hydrogen count is off, the oxygen count is off, it doesn’t taste 
like water, it doesn’t behave like water, it doesn’t freeze like water, 
it just looks like water. If we start to do these tests, the more we 
will know the true nature of the liquid in this glass. That is how we 
find truth. We can test it any number of ways; the more we test it, the 
more we know the truth of what it is that we’re dealing with.</p></blockquote><ul><li>An <a href="http://www.iamanexmormon.com/2011/05/this-is-how-i-discovered-truth-my-name-is-chris-and-im-an-ex-mormon/" rel="nofollow">ex-Mormon</a> implicitly describing Bayesian updates</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>"I spread the map out on the dining room table, and I 
held down the corners with cans of V8. The dots from where I'd found 
things looked like the stars in the universe. I connected them, like an 
astrologer, and if you squinted your eyes like a Chinese person, it kind
 of looked like the word 'fragile'. [...] I erased and connected the 
dots to make 'porte'. I had the revelation that I could connect the dots
 to make 'cyborg', and 'platypus', and 'boobs', and even 'Oskar', if you
 were extremely Chinese. <em>I could connect them to make almost anything I wanted, which meant I wasn't getting closer to anything</em>. And now I'll never know what I was supposed to find. And that's another reason I can't sleep."</p></blockquote><p>Jonathan Safran Foer, <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em> (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote><p>That's why it's so important to understand how unworried I
 was. I wasn't $400 worth of worried, or $100 worth of worried, or even 
$20 worth. I wouldn't have gone to the dermatologist if I didn't have 
health insurance. I probably wouldn't have gone if I had insurance but 
it had a big deductible, or even any real co-pay. The only reason I went

<blockquote><p>This was what made the fall of Iothiah so disastrous. ... Strategically, the loss of Iothiah was little more than a nuisance.</p><p>Symbolically, however…</p><p>The
 crisis she faced was a crisis in confidence, nothing more, nothing 
less. The less her subjects believed in the Empire, the less some would 
sacrifice, the more others would resist. It was almost arithmetic. The 
balance was wobbling, and all the world watched to see which way the 
sand would spill. She had made a resolution to act as if she believed to
 spite all those who doubted her as much as anything else, and 
paradoxically, they had all started believing with her. It was a lesson 
Kellhus had drummed into her countless times and one she resolved never 
to forget again.</p><p>To know is to have power over the world; to believe is to have power over men.</p></blockquote><p>Scott R. Bakker, <em>The White-Luck Warrior</em></p>

<p>"The seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of 
the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in 
them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions 
what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and 
demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is 
fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of 
the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the 
truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, 
and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it
 from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his 
critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either 
prejudice or leniency."</p>

  <p>If [Ayn] Rand really wanted to build an individualist sub-culture, 
she would have done so in an evolutionarily informed way.  If people 
naturally care about the opinions of others, jumping on people is a good
 way to get dishonest conformity, but a bad way to get an honest 
exchange of ideas.  Instead, an individualist sub-culture must be built 
upon tolerance and honesty.  I'd suggest three key norms:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Don't think less of people who sincerely disagree.</li>
  <li>Do think less of people who insincerely agree.</li>
  <li>Do think less of people who think less of people who sincerely disagree.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go 
forth to battle -- be Thou near them! With them -- in spirit -- we also 
go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe.
 O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with 
our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of
 their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the 
shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their 
humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of 
their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out
 roofless with little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their 
desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames 
of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with 
travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- for
 our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, 
protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their 
way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their 
wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source
 of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are
 sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Were it possible to trace the succession of ideas in the mind of 
Sir Isaac Newton, during the time that he made his greatest discoveries,
 I make no doubt but our amazement at the extent of his genius would a 
little subside. But if, when a man publishes his discoveries, he either 
through a design, or through habit, omit the intermediary steps by which
 he himself arrived at them, it is no wonder that his speculations 
confound them, and that the generality of mankind stand amazed at his 
reach of thought. If a man ascend to the top of a building by the help 
of a common ladder, but cut away most of the steps after he has done 
with them, leaving only every ninth of tenth step, the view of the 
ladder, in the condition which he has pleased to exhibit it, gives us a 
prodigious, but unjust view of the man who could have made use of it. 
But if he had intended that any body should follow him, he should have 
left the ladder as he constructed it, or perhaps as he found it, for it 
might have been a mere accident that threw it in his way... I think that
 the interests of science have suffered by the excessive admiration and 
wonder with which several first rate philosophers are considered, and 
that an opinion of the greater equality of mankind, in point of genius, 
and power of understanding, would be of real service in the present 
age."    - Joseph Priestly, The History and present State of Electricity</p></blockquote>

<p>The section where I've added an ellipsis is a section where he 
discusses Newton in more detail. That entire part of the text is worth 
reading. Priestly wrote the book before he did his work on the 
composition of air. The book is, as far as I am aware, the first attempt
 at actual history of science. (I'm meaning to read the whole thing at 
some point, but the occasionally archaic grammar makes for slow 
reading.)</p>

  <p>"The best thing for being sad," replied Merlin, beginning to puff 
and blow, "is to learn something. That's the only thing that never 
fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie 
awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss 
your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil 
lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. 
There is only one thing for it then — to learn. Learn why the world wags
 and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never 
exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, 
and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look 
what a lot of things there are to learn."</p></blockquote>

<p>For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime 
requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are 
capable of the highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest 
aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater 
progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those 
who, while they run, forsake it.</p>

<p>An irrationality quote from Samuel Johnson via Boswell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time 
together of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the 
nonexistence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely 
ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not 
true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity 
with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against
 a large stone, till he rebounded from it -- "I refute it thus."</p></blockquote>

get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in 
business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more 
depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the

<blockquote>
  <p>All scientists despise the ideology of 'breakthroughs' --- I mean 
the belief that science proceeds from one revelation to another, each 
one opening up a new world of understanding and advancing still farther a
 sharp line of demarcation between what is true and what is false. 
Everyone actually engaged in scientific research knows that this way of 
looking at things is altogether misleading, and that the frontier 
between understanding and bewilderment is rather like the plasma 
membrane of a cell as it creeps over its substratum, a pushing forward 
here, a retraction there --- an exploratory probing that will eventually
 move forward the whole body of the cell... in real life, science does 
not prance from one mountain top to the next.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When people talk about the importance of democracy, it is
 never democracy as it has ever actually functioned, with the 
politicians that have actually been elected, and the policies that have 
actually been implemented. It is always democracy as people imagine it 
will operate once they succeed in electing "the right people" — by which
 they mean, people who agree almost completely with their own views, and
 who are consistent and incorruptible in their implementation of the 
resulting policies.</p></blockquote><p>--Ben O'Neill, <a href="http://mises.org/daily/5879/Worship-of-the-Mob" rel="nofollow">here</a></p><p>Considering
 the above quote can be used to criticize nearly any popular political 
position I don't think it is inherently mind-killing. Also since we all 
agree <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jb/applause_lights/">democracy</a> is a good thing this isn't even very political. The original article and context obviously does make it somewhat political.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Stay, 'tis just a figure!" Root laughed rather winningly, reaching out to touch Locke's shoulder.</p><p>"A faulty one," Daniel said, "for you are an alchemist."</p><p>"I
 am called an Alchemist. Within living memory, Daniel, everyone who 
studied what I—and you—study was called by that name. And most persons 
even today observe no distinction between Alchemy and the younger and 
more vigorous order of knowledge that is associated with your club."</p><p>"I
 am too exhausted to harry you through all of your evasions. Out of 
respect for your friends Mr. Locke, and for Leibniz, I shall give you 
the benefit of the doubt, and wish you well," Daniel said.</p><p>"God save you, Mr. Waterhouse."</p><p>"And
 you, Mr. Root. But I say this to you—and you as well, Mr. Locke. As I 
came in here I saw a map, lately taken from this house, burning in the 
fire. The map was empty, for it depicted the ocean—most likely, a part 
of it where no man has ever been. A few lines of latitude were ruled 
across that vellum void, and some legendary isles drawn in, with great 
authority, and where the map-maker could not restrain himself he drew 
phantastickal monsters. That map, to me, is Alchemy. It is good that it 
burnt, and fitting that it burnt tonight, the eve of a Revolution that I
 will be so bold as to call my life's work. In a few years Mr. Hooke 
will learn to make a proper chronometer, finishing what Mr. Huygens 
began thirty years ago, and then the Royal Society will draw maps with 
lines of longitude as well as latitude, giving us a grid— what we call a
 Cartesian grid, though 'twas not his idea—and where there be islands, 
we will rightly draw them. Where there are none, we will draw none, nor 
dragons, nor sea-monsters—and that will be the end of Alchemy."</p></blockquote><p>Neal Stephenson, <em>Quicksilver</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The atmosphere of political parties, whether in France or

Minister, who is in the thick of a tough parliamentary struggle, must 
use whatever arguments he can to defend his cause without inquiring too 
closely whether they are good, bad, or indifferent. However good they 
may be, they will probably not convince his political opponents, and 
they can scarcely be so bad as not to carry some sort of conviction to 
the minds of those who are predisposed to support him.</p></blockquote><p>Evelyn Baring, Earl of Cromer, <em>Modern Egypt</em></p>

partially because they misremember their own behavior and partially 
because they like to been seen as the type of person who voted for the 
winner. 99% of geeks will report never having bought anything as a

behavior and partially because they believe that buying stuff from 
“spam” is something that people with AOL email addresses do, and hence 
admitting that they, too, can be marketed to will cause them to lose

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/COMPLEXITY-EMERGING-SCIENCE-ORDER-CHAOS/dp/0671872346/" rel="nofollow">M. Mitchell Waldrop</a> on a meeting between physicists and economists at the Santa Fe Institute:</p><blockquote><p>...as
 the axioms and theorems and proofs marched across the overhead 
projection screen, the physicists could only be awestruck at [the 
economists'] mathematical prowess — awestruck and appalled. They had the
 same objection that [Brian] Arthur and many other economists had been 
voicing from within the field for years. "They were almost too good," 
says one young physicist, who remembers shaking his head in disbelief. 
"lt seemed as though they were dazzling themselves with fancy 
mathematics, until they really couldn't see the forest for the trees. So
 much time was being spent on trying to absorb the mathematics that I 
thought they often weren't looking at what the models were for, and what
 they did, and whether the underlying assumptions were any good. In a 
lot of cases, what was required was just some common sense. Maybe if 
they all had lower IQs, they'd have been making some better models.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>...the 2008 financial crisis showed that some 
[mathematical finance] models were flawed. But those flaws were based on
 flawed assumptions about the distribution of price changes... Nassim 
Taleb, a popular author and critic of the financial industry, points out
 many such flaws but does not include the use of Monte Carlo simulations
 among them. He himself is a strong proponent of these simulations. 
Monte Carlo simulations are simply the way we do the math with uncertain
 quantities. Abandoning Monte Carlos because of the failures of the 
financial markets makes as much sense as giving up on addition and 
subtraction because of the failure of accounting at Enron or AIG’s 
overexposure in credit default swaps.</p></blockquote><p>Douglas Hubbard, <em>How to Measure Anything</em></p>

<blockquote><p>[O]ne may also focus on a single problem, which can 
appear in different guises in various disciplines, and vary the methods.
 An advantage of viewing the same problem through the lens of different 
models is that we can often begin to identify which features of the 
problem are enduring and which are artifacts of our particular methods 
or background assumptions. Because abstraction is a license for us to 
ignore information, looking at several approaches to modeling a problem 
can give you insight into what is important to keep and what is noise to
 ignore. Moreover, discovering robust features of a problem, when it 
happens, can reshape your intuitions.</p></blockquote><p>— Gregory Wheeler, <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/8780/1/Wheeler_FE2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Formal Epistemology</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Closeness in the experiment was reasonably literal but 
may also be interpreted in terms of identification with the torturer. If
 the church is doing the torturing then the especially religious may be 
more likely to think the tortured are guilty. If the state is doing the 
torturing then the especially patriotic (close to their country) may be 
more likely to think that the tortured/killed/jailed/abused are guilty. 
That part is fairly obvious but note the second less obvious 
implication–<em>the worse the victim is treated the more the religious/patriotic will believe the victim is guilty.</em>

people do evil things is more important than understanding why evil 
people do evil things.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/02/torture-in-a-just-world.html" rel="nofollow">Alex Tabarrok</a></p>

<blockquote><p>One of the most impressive features of brains – 
especially human brains — is the flexibility to learn almost any kind of
 task that comes its way. Give an apprentice the desire to impress his 
master and a chicken-sexing task, and his brain devotes its massive 
resources to distinguishing males from females. Give an unemployed 
aviation enthusiast a chance to be a national hero, and his brain learns
 to distinguish enemy aircraft from local flyboys. This flexibility of 
learning accounts for a large part of what we consider human 
intelligence. While many animals are properly called intelligent, humans
 distinguish themselves in that they are so <em>flexibly</em> 
intelligent, fashioning their neural circuits to match the task at hand.
 It is for this reason that we can colonize every region on the planet, 
learn the local language we’re born into, and master skills as diverse 
as playing the violin, high-jumping and operating space shuttle 
cockpits.</p></blockquote><p>David Eagleman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1368053746/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA" rel="nofollow">Incognito</a>, p. 71</p>

<blockquote><p>We would all like to believe that if we win something it 
is because of our skill, but if we lose it is because of the good luck 
or cheating of our opponent. This is nowhere more apparent than in the 
game of backgammon. A good opponent will play in such a way that the 
dice rolls having highest probability will be "good rolls" for them on 
their next turn, enabling them to take the other player's pieces, 
consolidate their position, etc. However, since there is an element of 
randomness, when these rolls actually come up it is very difficult even 
for me to believe that my opponent's fortune is due to their skill 
rather than their luck. Whenever I am being consistently beaten by an 
opponent I have to fight very hard to make myself believe that there is 
actually something wrong with my play and figure out how to correct it.</p><p>This
 phenomenon is nowhere more apparent than in computer backgammon. 
Computer backgammon is essentially a solved problem. Unlike Chess or Go,
 the best neural network algorithms that run even on modest hardware 
will consistently beat most human players, and perhaps draw with the 
best in the world. In fact, we have learnt rather a lot from these 
algorithms. Many rules of thumb that were believed for years by most 
decent players have been overturned by computer simulations. Computers 
tend to play backgammon markedly more aggressively than is natural for a
 human, but we can show that they are nevertheless doing the right 
thing. If you are not an extremely high level player, playing against a 
good computer algorithm feels weird if you are used to playing against 
humans.</p><p>One of the most annoying results of this is that it is 
impossible to obtain a reliable user generated rating of a backgammon 
program. For example, GNU Backgammon is one of the two or three best 
algorithms in the world and an under-appreciated gem of the GNU project 
as a whole. A full 50% of the user reviews on the Ubuntu software centre
 accuse the program of cheating by fixing the dice rolls and give it a 1
 or 2 star review. It is hilarious how many of these reviews include 
comments like they "know how to play" or have been "playing for a long 
time" as if this were evidence to support their claim. The rest of the 
reviews are by people who know better and they all give it 4 or 5 stars 
(4 is reasonable due to a few user interface quirks, but the algorithm 
itself is worth a 5). As a result, the averaged rating is only 3 stars, 
even though this is widely acknowledged as one of the three best 
backgammon programs in the world. It doesn't cheat because it doesn't 
have to, and it actually gives you mechanisms for checking that it is 
not cheating, e.g. entering dice rolls manually and a tutor mode that 
will correct your bad plays.</p><p>This phenomenon is repeated 
absolutely everywhere that user reviews of backgammon programs are 
available. On the Google Play store, I have seen this even on a program 
with an absolutely crappy algorithm that I can consistently beat on 
expert level as well as on decent ones that are backed by GNUbg. As a 
result, it is absolutely impossible to find out which are the good 
backgammon programs if you don't already know, since they all get a low 
average rating.</p></blockquote><p>-- <a href="https://plus.google.com/116973436260300431929/posts/RXCVL6PgTkp" rel="nofollow">Matthew Leifer</a></p>

<blockquote><p>What I have been calling nefarious rhetoric recurs in a 
rudimentary form also in impromptu discussions. Someone harbors a 
prejudice or an article of faith or a vested interest, and marshals ever
 more desperate and threadbare arguments in defense of his position 
rather than be swayed by reason or face the facts. Even more often, 
perhaps, the deterrent is just stubbon pride: reluctance to acknowledge 
error. Unscientific man is beset by a deplorable desire to have been 
right. The scientist is distinguished by a desire to <em>be</em> right.</p></blockquote><p>— W. V. Quine, <em>An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary</em> (a whimsical and fun read)</p>

<p>Rationality wakes up last:</p><blockquote><p>In those first seconds, 
I'm always thinking some version of this: "Oh, no!!! This time is 
different. Now my arm is dead and it's never getting better. I'm a 
one-armed guy now. I'll have to start drawing left-handed. I wonder if 
anyone will notice my dead arm. Should I keep it in a sling so people 
know it doesn't work or should I ask my doctor to lop it off? If only I 
had rolled over even once during the night. But nooo, I have to sleep on
 my arm until it dies. That is so like me. What happens if I sleep on 
the other one tomorrow night? Can I learn to use a fork with my feet?"</p><p>Then
 at about the fifth second, some feeling returns to my arm and I 
experience hope. I also realize that if people could lose their arms 
after sleeping on them there wouldn't be many people left on earth with 
two good arms. Apparently the rational part of my mind wakes up last.</p></blockquote><p>Scott Adams on <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/dead_arm/" rel="nofollow">waking up with a numb arm</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"...By the end of August, I was mentally drained, more 
drained, I think, than I had ever been. The creative potential, the 
capacity to solve problems, changes in a man in ebbs and flows, and over
 this he has little control. I had learned to apply a kind of test. I 
would read my own articles, those I considered the best. If I noticed in
 them lapses, gaps, if I saw that the thing could have been done better,
 my experiment was successful. If, however, I found myself reading with

<blockquote>
  <p>2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 - 2 =3, and 5 - 3 = 2 are not four facts, but four different ways of looking at <em>one</em>
 fact. Furthermore, that fact is not a fact of arithmetic, to be taken 
on faith and memorized like nonsense syllables. It is a fact of nature, 
which children can discover for themselves, and rediscover or verify for
 themselves as many times as they need or want to.</p>
  
  <p>The fact is this:</p>
  
  <p>***** -- *** **</p>
  
  <p>If you have before you a group of objects--coins or stones, for 
example---that looks like the group on the left, then you can make it 
into two groups that look like the ones on the right. Or--and this is 
what the two-way arrow means---if you have two groups that look like the
 ones on the right, you can make them into a group that looks like the 
one on the left.</p>
  
  <p>This is not a fact of arithmetic, but a fact of <em>nature</em>. It
 did not become true only when human beings invented arithmetic. It has 
nothing to do with human beings. It is true all over the universe. One 
doesn't have to know any arithmetic to discover or verify it. An infant 
playing with blocks or a dog pawing at sticks might do that operation, 
though probably neither of them would notice that he had done it; for 
them, the difference between ***** and *** ** would be a difference that
 didn't make any difference. Arithmetic began (and begins) when human 
beings began to notice and think about this and other numerical facts of
 nature.</p></blockquote>

<p>"We can get very confused, because we think that words must have some
 secret meaning that we have to figure out. They don't. They are just 
noises or marks, and they mean whatever experience you have learned to 
mean by them. People tend to use similar words in similar situations, 
but unless you have specifically agreed on what the words will mean, in 
terms of underlying experiences, there's no way to know what another 
person understands when you use them. The experience you attach to a 
word when you say it isn't automatically the same as the experience 
another person attaches to the same word when hearing it."</p>

  <p>"I do not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to misattribute it to Voltaire."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>-Voltaire</em></p>

<p>(The phrase was written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall as a summary of 
Voltaire's attitude toward free speech. Since then, people started 
attributing it to Voltaire himself, and the myth has spread far and 
wide, as nobody really checks to see if he actually said that. Hearing 
something somewhere is plenty of evidence for most people, most of the 
time, and the conviction gets more solid over time. Which brings me to 
my second rationality quote, from Winston Churchill: "A lie gets halfway
 around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.")</p>

  <p>Arg, this post is bringing back memories of all kinds of 
backcountry stupidity (including a fair amount of my own stupidity), so I
 can't resist adding a comment about GPS devices. Any navigation tool --
 GPS device, map, compass, sextant, whatever -- only works if you are 
using the navigation tool to relate yourself to the surrounding 
landscape. And you should never trust maps, GPS devices, compasses, or 
any tool if it contradicts what you're seeing in the surrounding 
landscape. I own a top-notch brand of GPS device, I got a top-quality 
map to go inside it, and when I checked the map against a landscape I 
knew well, I found error after error (which is true with all maps, by 
the way; one of the reasons I like paper maps is that I can make 
notations on it when I find errors).</p></blockquote>

  <p>"Then the one called Raltariki is really a demon?" asked Tak.</p>
  
  <p>"Yes—and no," said Yama. "If by 'demon' you mean a malefic, 
supernatural creature, possessed of great powers, life span, and the 
ability to temporarily assume virtually any shape—then the answer is no.
 This is the generally accepted definition, but it is untrue in one 
respect."</p>
  
  <p>"Oh? And what may that be?"</p>
  
  <p>"It is not a supernatural creature."</p>
  
  <p>"But it is all those other things?"</p>
  
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  
  <p>"Then I fail to see what difference it makes whether it be 
supernatural or not—so long as it is malefic, possesses great powers and
 life span and has the ability to change its shape at will."</p>
  
  <p>"Ah, but it makes a great deal of difference, you see. It is the 
difference between the unknown and the unknowable, between science and 
fantasy—it is a matter of essence. The four points of the compass be 
logic, knowledge, wisdom and the unknown. Some bow in that final 
direction. Others advance upon it. To bow before the one is to lose 
sight of the three. I may submit to the unknown, but never to the 
unknowable. The man who bows in that final direction is either a saint 
or a fool. I have no use for either."</p></blockquote>

<p>When I was 14, my father was stationed in Japan. I went rock climbing
 with this kid from school. He fell and got injured, and I had to bring 
him to the hospital. We came in through the wrong entrance, and passed 
this guy in the hall. He was a janitor. My friend came down with an 
infection, and the doctors didn't know what to do. So they brought in 
the janitor. He was a doctor. And a Buraku - one of Japan's 
untouchables. His ancestors had been slaughterers, gravediggers. And 
this guy knew that he wasn't accepted by the staff, didn't even try. He 
didn't dress well. He didn't pretend to be one of them. People around 
that place didn't think he had anything they wanted, except when they 
needed him - because he was right, which meant that nothing else 
mattered. And they had to listen to him.</p>

  <p>The necessity for marking our classes has brought with it a bias

There is no feat of irrelevance that people will not perform quite 
easily in this way; there is no class, however accidental, to which they
 will not at once ascribe deeply distinctive qualities. The seventh sons
 of seventh sons have remarkable powers of insight; people with a 
certain sort of ear commit crimes of violence; people with red hair have
 souls of fire; all democratic socialists are trustworthy persons; all 
people born in Ireland have vivid imaginations and all Englishmen are 
clods; all Hindoos are cowardly liars; all curly-haired people are 
good-natured; all hunch-backs are energetic and wicked, and all 
Frenchmen eat frogs. Such stupid generalisations have been believed with
 the utmost readiness, and acted upon by great numbers of sane, 
respectable people. And when the class is one's own class, when it 
expresses one of the aggregations to which one refers one's own 
activities, then the disposition to divide all qualities between this 
class and its converse, and to cram one's own class with every desirable
 distinction, becomes overwhelming.</p></blockquote>

<p>On rationalization, aka the giant sucking cognitive black hole.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though [Ben Franklin] had been a vegetarian on principle, on one 
long sea crossing the men were grilling fish, and his mouth started 
watering:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>I balanc'd some time between principle and inclination, till I 
recollectd that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out
 of their stomachs; then thought I, "if you eat one another, I don't see
 why we mayn't eat you." So I din'd upon cod very heartily, and 
continued to eat with other people, returning only now and then 
occasionally to a vegetable diet.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Franklin concluded: "So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable
 creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing
 one has a mind to do."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an old saying, which I learnt from the 1994 movie <em>Forrest Gump</em> (not otherwise a bastion of rationalism).</p>

 know (epistemic rationality, roughly), it's instrumental rationality 
that matters in the end.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tell me, Eben: how is’t, d’you think, that the planets are moved in their courses?”</p>
  
  <p>“Why, said Ebenezer, “’tis that the cosmos is filled with little 
particles moving in vortices, each of which centers on a star; and ‘tis 
the subtle push and pull of these particles in our solar vortex that 
slides the planets along their orbs – is’t not?”</p>
  
  <p>“So saith Descartes,” Burlingame smiled. “And d’you haply recall what is the nature of light?”</p>
  
  <p>“If I have’t right,” replied Ebenezer, “’tis an aspect of the 
vortices – of the press of inward and outward forces in ‘em. The 
celestial fire is sent through space from the vortices by this pressure,
 which imparts a transitional motion to little light globules – ”</p>
  
  <p>“Which Renatus kindly hatched for that occasion,” Burlingame 
interrupted. “And what’s more he allows his globules both a rectilinear 
and a rotatary motion. If only the first occurs when the globules smite 
our retinae, we see white light; if both, we see color. And if this were
 not magical enough – mirabile dictu! – when the rotatory motion 
surpasseth the rectilinear, we see blue; when the reverse, we see red; 
and when the twain are equal, we see yellow. What fantastical drivel!”</p>
  
  <p>“You mean ‘tis not the truth? I must say, Henry, it sounds 
reasonable to me. In sooth, there is a seed of poetry in it; it hath an 
elegance.”</p>
  
  <p>“Aye, it hath every virtue and but one small defect, which is, that the universe doth not operate in that wise.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I am thinking of coding up a web app for accumulating, voting, and commenting on quotes. Kind of like bash.org but much fancier.</p>

<p>Is that something you guys would be interested in? If so, what features would you want?</p>

<p>This would be free to use of course, and the site would not lock down the data (ie it would be exportable to various formats).</p>

<p>I am thinking there are a lot of communities that post quotes for 
internal use, and might be interested in a kind of unified web site for 
this. My initial thought is that it would be like Reddit, where each 
tribe/community/subculture/topic/etc gets its own subdirectory.</p>

  <p>The nurse recorded the time of death, 9:21 P.M. He discovered, 
oddly, that the clock had halted at that moment —just the sort of 
mystical phenomenon that appealed to unscientific people. Then an 
explanation occurred to him. He knew the clock was fragile, because he 
had repaired it several times, and he decided that the nurse must have 
stopped it by picking it up to check the time in the dim light.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Who first called Reason sweet, I don't know. I suspect that he was a
 man with very few responsibilities, no children to rear, and no payroll
 to meet. An anchorite with heretical tendencies, maybe, or the idle 
youngest son of a wealthy Athenian. The dictates of Reason are often 
difficult to figure out, rarely to my liking, and profitable only by 
what seems a happy but remarkably unusual accident. Mostly, Reason 
brings bad news, and bad news of the worst sort, for, if it is truly the
 word of Reason, there is no denying it or weaseling out of its demands 
without simply deciding to be irrational. Thus it is that I have 
discovered, and many others, I notice, have also discovered, all sorts 
of clever ways to convince myself that Reason is "mere" Reason, powerful
 and right, of course, but infinitely outnumbered by <em>reasons</em>, my reasons.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Rejecting all organs of information therefore but my senses, I rid 
myself of the Pyrrhonisms with which an indulgence in speculations 
hyperphysical and antiphysical so uselessly occupy and disquiet the 
mind. A single sense may indeed be sometimes decieved, but rarely: and 
never all our senses together, with their faculty of reasoning. They 
evidence realities; and there are enough of these for all the purposes 
of life, without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams and 
phantasms. I am satisfied, and sufficiently occupied with the things 
which are, without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may 
indeed be, but of which I have no evidence.</p>
  
  <p>I am sure that I really know many, many, things, and none more 
surely than that I love you with all my heart, and pray for the 
continuance of your life until you shall be tired of it yourself.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The ultimate theological question is: ‘Where does the Sun go at night?’.</p><p>The
 answer that so many civilisations agreed for so long was: ‘The Sun is 
driven by one of the gods, and at night it goes under the Earth to fight
 a battle. There is at least some risk that the god will lose this 
battle, and so the Sun may not rise tomorrow’. It’s something the human 
race understood was a cast iron fact before they knew how to cast iron. 
It survived as the working model twenty-five times longer than the four 
hundred years we’ve understood the Earth goes around the Sun.</p></blockquote><p>Lance Parkin, <a href="https://lanceparkin.wordpress.com/2011/12/31/above-us-only-sky/" rel="nofollow">Above us only sky</a></p><p>This
 is less a rationality quote than a "yay science" quote, but I find that
 impressive beyond words. For millenia that was a huge and frightening 
question, and then we went and answered it, and now it's too trivial to 
point out. We found out where the sun goes at night. I want to carve a 
primer on cosmology in gold letters on a mountain, entitled something in
 all caps along the lines of "HERE IS THE GLORY OF HUMANKIND".</p>

<blockquote><p>But even as light is opposed by darkness, science and 
reason have their enemies. Superstition and belief in magic are as old 
as man himself; for the intransigence of facts and our limitations in 
controlling them can be powerfully hard to take. Add to this the 
reflection that we are in an age when it is popular to distrust whatever
 is seen as the established view or the Establishment, and it is no 
wonder that anti-rational attitudes and doctrines are mustering so much 
support. Still, we can understand what encourages the anti-rationalist 
turn without losing our zeal for opposing it. A current Continuing 
Education catalogue offers a course description, under the heading 
"Philosophy", that typifies the dark view at its darkest: "Children of 
science that we are, we have based our cultural patterns on logic, on 
the cognitive, on the verifiable. But more and more there has crept into
 current research and study the haunting suggestion that there are other
 kinds of knowledge unfathomable by our cognition, other ways of knowing
 beyond the limits of our logic, which are deserving of our serious 
attention." Now "knowledge unfathomable by our cognition" is simply 
incoherent, as attention to the words makes clear. Moreover, all that 
creeps is not gold. One wonders how many students enrolled.</p></blockquote><p>-- W. V. O. Quine</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism" rel="nofollow">[Instrumentalism about science</a>]
 has a long and rather sorry philosophical history: most contemporary 
philosophers of science regard it as fairly conclusively refuted. But I 
think it’s easier to see what’s wrong with it just by noticing that real
 science just isn’t like this. According to instrumentalism, 
palaeontologists talk about dinosaurs so they can understand fossils, 
astrophysicists talk about stars so they can understand photoplates, 
virologists talk about viruses so they can understand NMR instruments, 
and particle physicists talk about the Higgs Boson so they can 
understand the LHC. In each case, it’s quite clear that instrumentalism 
is the wrong way around. Science is not “about” experiments; science is 
about the world, and experiments are part of its toolkit.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/11/18/guest-post-david-wallace-on-the-physicality-of-the-quantum-state/" rel="nofollow">David Wallace</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I guess my point here is that part of the reason I stayed
 in Mormonism so long was that the people arguing against Mormonism were
 using such ridiculously bad arguments. I tried to find the most 
rigorous reasoning and the strongest research that opposed LDS theology,
 but the best they could come up with was stuff like horses in the Book 
of Mormon. It's so easy for a Latter-Day Saint to simply write the horse
 references off as either a slight mistranslation or a gap in current 
scientific knowledge that that kind of "evidence" wasn't worth the time 
of day to me. And for every horse problem there was something like Hugh 
Nibley's "Two Shots in the Dark" or Eugene England's work on Lehi's 
alleged travels across Saudi Arabia, apologetic works that made Mormon 
historical and theological claims look vaguely plausible. There were 
bright, thoughtful people on both sides of the Mormon apologetics 
divide, but the average IQ was definitely a couple of dozen points 
higher in the Mormon camp.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.exmormon.org/whylft18.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.exmormon.org/whylft18.htm</a></p>

<p>Joe Pyne was a confrontational talk show host and amputee, which I 
say for reasons that will become clear. For reasons that will never 
become clear, he actually thought it was a good idea to get into a 
zing-fight with Frank Zappa, his guest of the day. As soon as Zappa had 
been seated, the following exchange took place:</p><blockquote><p>Pyne: I guess your long hair makes you a girl.</p><p>Zappa: I guess your wooden leg makes you a table.</p></blockquote><p>Of course this would imply that Pyne is not a <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/nj/similarity_clusters/">featherless biped</a>.</p><p>Source: Robert Cialdini's <em>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</em></p>

<blockquote><p>He who says "Better to go without belief forever than 
believe a lie!" merely shows his own... private horror of becoming a

 keep out of battle forever than to risk a single wound. Not so are 
victories... over enemies or over nature gained.</p></blockquote><p>William James</p>

<blockquote><p>So, in a business setting, you’ve got to provide value to
 your customers so that they pay for the goods and services that you’re 
providing. Philanthropy is unfortunate in that the people that your 
customer base is made of oftentimes are the people that are writing the 
checks to support you. The people that are writing the donation checks 
are what keep organizations in business oftentimes. The people that are 
receiving the services, then, are oftentimes not paying for the 
services, and therefore their voice is not heard. And so within the 
nonprofit space, we’ve created a system where he/she who tells the best 
story is the one that’s rewarded. There’s an incentive to push down the 
stories that are not of positive impact. There’s the incentive to 
pretend that there are no negative things that happen, there’s the 
incentive to make sure that our failures are never made public, and 
there’s the disconnected between who’s paying for the service and who’s 
receiving the services. When you disconnect those two aspects, you do 
not have accountability that acts in the best interest of the people who
 are receiving what we are all trying to do, which is just to help in 
places of great need.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybowyer/2013/07/30/your-help-is-hurting-how-church-foreign-aid-programs-make-things-worse/" rel="nofollow">Peter Greer</a></p>

don't exactly live in us, but there they sit all the same and we can't 
get rid of them.  All I have to do is pick up a newspaper, and I see 
ghosts lurking between the lines.  I think there are ghosts everywhere

<blockquote>
  <p>There is an unfortunate optical illusion - a variant on the Doppler
 effect - that besets all frauds. It's unfortunate, because it has the 
effect of exacerbating the pecuniary losses that fraud victims endure, 
by unfairly leaving them, like many rape victims, irrationally ashamed 
of themselves.</p>
  
  <p>The Doppler principle we posit holds that as a victim approaches a 
swindler, he sees nothing but green lights. But as soon as he realizes 
that his money is gone, he spins around and beholds, as if by magic, 
bright red flags as far as the eye can see.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe 
which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a 
star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. That was the most 
arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it 
was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled
 and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such a
 fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how 
miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the 
human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which 
it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, 
nothing will have happened."</p></blockquote>

  <p>This problem affects a question close to Frances Kamm’s work: what 
she calls the Problem of Distance in Morality (PDM). Kamm says that her 
intuition consistently finds that moral obligations attach to things 
that are close to us, but not to thinks that are far away. According to 
her, if we see a child drowning in a pond and there’s a machine nearby 
which, for a dollar, will scoop him out, we’re morally obligated to give
 the machine a dollar. But if the machine is here but the scoop and 
child are on the other side of the globe, we don’t have to put a dollar 
in the machine. --<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/moralbiases" rel="nofollow">Aaron Swartz</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man cannot understand the perfection and imperfections of his 
chosen art if he cannot see the value in other arts. Following rules 
only permits development up to a point in technique and then the student
 and artist has to learn more and seek further. It makes sense to study 
other arts as well as those of strategy. Who has not learned something 
more about themselves by watching the activities of others? To learn the
 sword study the guitar. To learn the fist study commerce. To just study
 the sword will make you narrow-minded and will not permit you to grow 
outward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Prompted by the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/2t8/sam_harris_surprisingly_modest_proposal/">discussion</a> of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-02/sam-harris-on-the-moral-landscape/" rel="nofollow">Sam Harriss idea</a> that science should provide for a universal moral code, I thought of this suitable reply given long ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The] doctrine of right and wrong is perpetually disputed, both by 
the pen and the sword: whereas the doctrine of lines and figures is not 
so, because men care not in that subject what be truth, as a thing that 
crosses no man's ambition, profit, or lust. For I doubt not, but if it 
had been a thing contrary to any man's right of dominion, or to the 
interest of men that have dominion, that <em>the three angles of a triangle should be equal to two angles of a square</em>,
 that doctrine [would] have been, if not disputed, yet by the burning of
 all books of geometry suppressed, as far as he whom it concerned was 
able.</p>
  
  <p>Thomas Hobbes, <em>Leviathan</em> (1651)</p></blockquote>

<p>(It also provides for some interesting perspective on the current 
epistemological state of various academic fields that are taken 
seriously as a source of guidance for government policy.)</p>

<p>Dirge without Music <br><br>
Edna St. Vincent Millay</p>

<p>I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground. <br><br>
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind: <br><br>
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned <br><br>
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.</p>

<p>Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you. <br><br>
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust. <br><br>
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew, <br><br>
A formula, a phrase remains, --- but the best is lost.</p>

<p>The answers quick  keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love, <br><br>
They are gone. They have gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled <br><br>
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve. <br><br>
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.</p>

<p>Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave <br><br>
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind; <br><br>
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave. <br><br>
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.</p>

  <p>Take the bettors in the racetrack experiment. Thirty seconds before
 putting down their money, they had been tentative and uncertain; thirty
 seconds after the deed, they were significantly more optimistic ans 
self-assured. The act of making a final decision--in this case, of 
buying a ticket--had been the critical factor. Once a stand had been 
taken, the need for consistency pressured these people to bring what 
they felt and believed into line with what they had already done. They 
simply convinced themselves that they had made the right choice and, no 
doubt, felt better and it all.</p></blockquote>

<p>"But can people in desperate poverty be considered to be making free

one’s kidney really a choice? Yes; an easy one. One of the options is 
awful. To forbid organ selling is to take away the better choice. If we 
choose to provide an even better option to the person that would be 
great – but it is no solution to the problem of poverty to take away

coordinate their mental muscles to make a purposed movement.  They have 
no real Will, only a set of wishes, many of which contradict others.  
The victim wobbles from one to the other  (and it is no less wobbling 
because the movements may occasionally be very  violent), and at the end
 of life the movements cancel each other out.  Nothing has been 
achieved, except the one thing of which the victim is not conscious: the
 destruction of his own character, the confirming of indecision.</p></blockquote>

<p>-- Aleister Crowley, <em>Liber ABA</em></p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5r/crowley_on_religious_experience/">Crowley</a>'s
 writings are an odd mixture of utter raving, self-conscious mysticism, 
and surprising introspective clarity.  The above refers to his concept 
of True Will, which reads at times like an occultist's parameterization 
of epistemic rationality; some of his writings on meditation, too, 
wouldn't look too far out of place as top-level posts here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we know someone's objective and also know that half the 
time that person correctly figures out how to achieve it and half the 
time he acts at random. Since there is generally only one right way of 
doing things (or perhaps a few) but very many wrong ways, the "rational"
 behavior can be predicted but the "irrational" behavior cannot. If we 
predict the person's behavior on the assumption that he is rational, we 
will be right half the time. If we assume he is irrational, we will 
almost never be right, since we still have to guess <em>which</em> 
irrational thing he will do. We are better off assuming he is rational 
and recognizing that we will sometimes be wrong. To put the argument 
more generally, the tendency to be rational is the consistent (and hence
 predictable) element in human behavior. The only alternative to 
assuming rationality (other than giving up and assuming that human 
behavior cannot be understood and predicted) would be a <em>theory</em> of irrational behavior - a theory that told us not only that someone would not always do the rational thing but also <em>which particular irrational thing</em> he would do. So far as I know, no satisfactory theory of that sort exists.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Imagine that everyone in North America took [a cognitive 
enhancement pill] before retiring and then woke up the next morning with
 more memory capacity and processing speed... I believe that there is 
little likelihood that much would change the next day in terms of human 
happiness. It is very unlikely that people would be better able to 
fulfill their wishes and desires the day after taking the pill. In fact,
 it is quite likely that people would simply go about their usual 
business - only more efficiently. If given more memory capacity and 
processing speed, people would, I believe: carry on using the same 
ineffective medical treatments because of failure to think of 
alternative causes; keep making the same poor financial decisions 
because of overconfidence; keep misjudging environmental risks because 
of vividness; play host to the [tempting bad ideas] of Ponzi and pyramid
 schemes; [and] be wrongly influenced in their jury decisions by 
incorrect testimony about probabilities... The only difference would be 
that they would be able to do all of these things much more quickly!</p></blockquote>

  <p>Whether their motives were righteous or venal, highminded or base, 
noble or ig-, in retrospect the obvious verdict is that they were all 
morons--yes, even the distinguished fellows and visiting scholars at 
think tanks and deans of international studies schools. They were morons
 because the whole moral, political and practical purpose of their 
scheme depended on its going exactly according to plan. Which nothing 
ever does. The Latin phrase for this logical fallacy would be <em>Duh</em>.
 Some of them were halfway intelligent; some of them may even have been 
well-intentioned; but they lacked imagination, and this is a fatal flaw.
 What we learn from history is that it never turns out like it's 
supposed to. And the one thing we know for sure about the future is that
 it won't be like we think.</p></blockquote>

<p>"If a theory has a lot of parameters, you adjust their values to fit a
 lot of data, and your theory is not really predicting those things, 
just accommodating them.  Scientists use words like “curve fitting” and 
“fudge factors” to describe that sort of activity.  On the other hand, 
if a theory has just a few parameters but applies to a lot of data, it 
has real power.  You can use a small subset of the measurements to fix 
the parameters; then all other measurements are uniquely predicted. "

<p>Prompted by <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/94r/rationality_quotes_january_2012/5lgz">Maniakes</a>, but sufficiently different to post separately:</p><blockquote><p>It
 cannot have escaped philosophers' attention that our fellow academics 
in other fields--especially in the sciences--often have difficulty 
suppressing their incredulous amusement when such topics as Twin Earth, 
Swampman, and Blockheads are posed for apparently serious consideration.
 Are the scientists just being philistines, betraying their tin ears for
 the subtleties of philosophical investigation, or have the philosophers
 who indulge in these exercises lost their grip on reality?</p><p>These 
bizarre examples all attempt to prove one "conceptual" point or another 
by deliberately reducing something underappreciated to zero, so that 
What Really Counts can shine through. Blockheads hold peripheral 
behavior constant and reduce internal structural details (and--what 
comes to the same thing--intervening internal processes) close to zero, 
and provoke the intuition that then there would be no mind there; 
internal structure Really Counts. Manthra is more or less the 
mirror-image; it keeps internal processes constant and reduces control 
of peripheral behavior to zero, showing, presumably, that external 
behavior Really Doesn't Count. Swampman keeps both future peripheral 
dispositions and internal states constant and reduces "history" to zero.
 Twin Earth sets internal similarity to maximum, so that external 
context can be demonstrated to be responsible for whatever our 
intuitions tell us. Thus these thought experiments mimic empirical 
experiments in their design, attempting to isolate a crucial interaction
 between variables by holding other variables constant. In the past I 
have often noted that a problem with such experiments is that the 
dependent variable is "intuition"--they are intuition pumps--and the 
contribution of imagination in the generation of intuitions is harder to
 control than philosophers have usually acknowledged.</p><p>But there is
 also a deeper problem with them. It is child's play to dream up further
 such examples to "prove" further conceptual points. <strong>Suppose a 
cow gave birth to something that was atom-for-atom indiscernible from a 
shark. Would it be a shark? What is the truth-maker for sharkhood? If 
you posed that question to a biologist, the charitable reaction would be
 that you were making a labored attempt at a joke. Suppose an evil demon
 could make water turn solid at room temperature by smiling at it; would
 demon-water be ice? Too silly a hypothesis to deserve a response.</strong>
 All such intuition pumps depend on the distinction spelled out by 
McLaughlin and O'Leary-Hawthorne between "conceptual" and "reductive" 
answers to the big questions. What I hadn't sufficiently appreciated in 
my earlier forthright response to Jackson is that when one says that the
 truth-maker question requires a conceptual answer, one means an answer 
that holds not just in our world, or all nomologically possible worlds, 
but in all logically possible worlds. <strong>Smiling demons, 
cow-sharks, Blockheads, and Swampmen are all, some philosophers think, 
logically possible, even if they are not nomologically possible, and 
these philosophers think this is important. I do not. Why should the 
truth-maker question cast its net this wide? Because, I gather, 
otherwise its answer doesn't tell us about the essence of the topic in 
question. But who believes in real essences of this sort nowadays? Not 
I.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Daniel Dennett, <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/getreal.htm" rel="nofollow">Get Real</a> (emphasis added).</p>

<p>The human understanding is no dry light, but receives an infusion 
from the will and affections; whence proceed sciences which may be 
called "sciences as one would." For what a man had rather were true he 
more readily believes. Therefore he rejects difficult things from 
impatience of research; sober things, because they narrow hope; the 
deeper things of nature, from superstition; the light of experience, 
from arrogance and pride, lest his mind should seem to be occupied with 
things mean and transitory; things not commonly believed, out of 
deference to the opinion of the vulgar. Numberless, in short, are the 
ways, and sometimes imperceptible, in which the affections color and 
infect the understanding.</p><p>-- Francis Bacon, <em>Novum Organum</em> (Aphorism XLIX), 1620. (<a href="http://www.constitution.org/bacon/nov_org.htm" rel="nofollow">1863 translation</a> by Spedding, Ellis and Heath. You should read the whole thing, it's all this good.)</p>

<blockquote><p>But when we have these irrational beliefs, these 
culturally coded assumptions, running so deep within our community and 
movement, how do we actually change that? How do we get people to 
further question themselves when they’ve already become convinced that 
they’re a rational person, a skeptic, and have moved on from 
irrationality, cognitive distortion and bias?</p><p>Well I think what we
 need to do is to change the fundamental structure and values of 
skepticism. We need to build our community and movement around slightly 
different premises.</p><p>As it has stood in the past, skepticism has 
been predicated on a belief in the power of the empirical and rational. 
It has been based on the premise that there is an empirical truth, and 
that it is knowable, and that certain tools and strategies like science 
and logic will allow us to reach that truth. In short, the “old guard” 
skepticism was based on a veneration of the rational. But the veneration
 of certain techniques or certain philosophies creates the problematic 
possibility of choosing to consider certain conclusions or beliefs to BE
 empirical and rational and above criticism, particularly beliefs 
derived from the “right” tools, and even more dangerously, to consider 
oneself “rational”.</p><p>...</p><p>I believe that in order to be able 
to question our own beliefs as well as we question those of others, we 
need to restructure skepticism around awareness of human limitation, 
irrationality and flaws. Rather than venerating the rational, and 
aspiring to become some kind of superhuman fully rational vulcan minds, 
we need to instead create a more human skepticism, built around 
understanding how belief operates, how we draw conclusions, and how we 
can cope with the human limitations. I believe we need to remove the 
focus from aspiring towards ridding ourselves of the irrational, and 
instead move the focus towards understanding how this irrationality 
operates and why we believe all the crazy things we believe. We need to 
position as our primary aspiration not the achievement of a perfect 
comprehending mind, but instead an ability to maintain constant 
hesitation and doubt, to always always ALWAYS second-guess our positions
 and understand that they’re being created through a flawed mind, from 
flawed perceptions.</p><p>Science and reason are excellent tools to 
allow us to cope with being crazy, irrational human beings, but it 
CANNOT allow us to transcend that. The instant we begin to believe that 
we have become A Skeptic, A Rational Person, that is when we’ve fucked 
up, that is when we stop practicing skepticism, stop keeping an eye out 
for our mistakes, and begin to imagine our irrational perceptions as 
perfect rational conclusions. It’s only by building a skepticism based 
on the practice of doubt, rather than the state of Skeptic, that we’ll 
truly be able to be move on from our assumptions.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Natalie Reed, <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/02/22/outline-getting-skeptics-to-think-skeptically-about-their-skepticism/" rel="nofollow">Getting Skeptics to Think Rationally About Their Skepticism</a></li></ul>

<blockquote><p>If we see in each generation the conflict of the future 
against the past, the fight of what might be called progressive versus 
reactionary, we shall find ourselves organizing the historical story 
upon what is really an unfolding principle of progress, and our eyes 
will be fixed upon certain people who appear as the special agencies of 
that progress. [...] But if we see in each generation a clash of wills 
out of which there emerges something that probably no man ever willed, 
our minds become concentrated upon the process that produced such an 
unpredictable issue, and we are more open for an intensive study of the 
motions and interactions that underlie historical change. [...] The 
process of the historical transition will then be recognized to be 
unlike what the whig historian seems to assume – much less like the 
procedure of a logical argument and perhaps much more like the method by
 which a man can be imagined to work his way out of a "complex". It is a
 process which moves by mediations and those mediations may be provided 
by anything in the world – by men’s sins or misapprehensions or by what 
we can only call fortunate conjunctures. Very strange bridges are used 
to make the passage from one state of things to another; we may lose 
sight of them in our surveys of general history, but their discovery is 
the glory of historical research. History is not the study of origins; 
rather it is the analysis of all the mediations by which the past was 
turned into our present.</p></blockquote><p>-- Herbert Butterfield, <em>The Whig Interpretation of History</em></p>

<blockquote><p>"Well, how about this — that man, unlike animals, is a 
creature who experiences an insurmountable need for knowledge? I've read
 that somewhere."</p><p>"So have I," said Valentine. "But the trouble is
 that man, or in any case the common man, easily overcomes this need for
 knowledge of his. It seems to me that he doesn't have such a need at 
all. There's a need to understand, but knowledge is not required for 
that. The God hypothesis, for instance, gives one an unparalleled 
ability to understand absolutely everything, while discovering 
absolutely nothing... Give a person a highly simplified model of the 
world and interpret any event on the basis of this simplified model. 
Such an approach required no knowledge. A few memorized formulas plus 
some so-called intuition, so-called practical acumen, and so-called 
common sense."</p></blockquote><p><em>Roadside Picnic</em>, Boris and Arkady Strugatsky</p>

<blockquote><p>Don't you understand anything about commitment, about 
being a pro, about sticking with what you say you wanna be? You don't do
 it just when you feel good. You don't do it just when you're not tired.
 You don't do it just when it's sunny. You do it every day of your life.
 You do it when it hurts to do it, when it's the last thing in the world
 that you wanna do, when there are a million reasons not to do it. You 
do it because you're a professional.</p></blockquote><p>-- Teddy Atlas</p>

<p>From the remarkable opening chapter of <em>Consciousness Explained</em>:</p><blockquote><p>One
 should be leery of these possibilities in principle. It is also 
possible in principle to build a stainless-steel ladder to the moon, and
 to write out, in alphabetical order, all intelligible English 
conversations consisting of less than a thousand words. But neither of 
these are remotely possible in fact and sometimes an <em>impossibility in fact</em> is theoretically more interesting than a <em>possibility in principle</em>, as we shall see.</p></blockquote><p>--Daniel Dennett</p>

<blockquote><p>The hidden thought embedded in most discussions of 
conspiracy theories is this: The world is being controlled by evil 
people; so, if we can get rid of them, the world can revert to control 
by good people, and things will be great again. This thought is false. 
The world is not controlled by any group of people – evil or good – and 
it will not be. The world is a large, chaotic mess. Those groups which 
do exert some control are merely larger pieces in the global mix.</p></blockquote><p>-- Paul Rosenberg</p>

<blockquote><p>At college in 1980, my Government Studies prof also 
served as Secretary of the Socialist Workers Party of Minnesota (the 
real one, not the DFL). We clashed over Robert Mugabe, just coming to 
power in Zimbabwe, he asserting it spelled salvation and I, that it 
spelled ruin.</p><p>I e-mailed him a year or two ago, asking if I could 
get a retroactive grade increase since my predictions had proven more 
accurate than his. His explanation was that he truly believed Mugabe was
 an agrarian reformer whose program of taking land from Whites to give 
to Blacks would benefit the country; but things just hadn't worked out 
as hoped.</p><p>I didn't bother to send him the famous Heinlein quote 
about Bad Luck. And I didn't really expect the grade change. But it 
certainly was satisfying to say "I told you so" 30 years later.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/2013/06/mailvox-lessons-of-history.html" rel="nofollow">JD</a></p>

  <p>It's a wonderful thing to be clever, and you should never think 
otherwise, and you should never stop being that way. But what you learn,
 as you get older, is that there are a few million other people in the 
world all trying to be clever at the same time, and whatever you do with
 your life will certainly be lost - swallowed up in the ocean - unless 
you are doing it with like-minded people who will remember your 
contributions and carry them forward. That is why the world is divided

<blockquote>
  <p>When I became convinced that the Universe is natural — that all the
 ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul, 
into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, the joy of freedom.
 The walls of my prison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was flooded with 
light, and all the bolts, and bars, and manacles became dust. I was no 
longer a servant, a serf, or a slave. There was for me no master in all 
the wide world — not even in infinite space. I was free — free to think,
 to express my thoughts — free to live to my own ideal — free to live 
for myself and those I loved — free to use all my faculties, all my 
senses — free to spread imagination’s wings — free to investigate, to 
guess and dream and hope — free to judge and determine for myself — free
 to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the “inspired” books that 
savages have produced, and all the barbarous legends of the past — free 
from the popes and priests — free from all the “called” and “set apart” —
 free from sanctified mistakes and holy lies — free from the fear of 
eternal pain — free from the winged monsters of the night — free from 
devils, ghosts, and gods. For the first time I was free. There were no 
prohibited places in all the realms of thought — no air, no space, where
 fancy could not spread her painted wings — no chains for my limbs — no 
lashes for my back — no fires for my flesh — no master’s frown or threat
 — no following another’s steps — no need to bow, or cringe, or crawl, 
or utter lying words. I was free. I stood erect and fearlessly, 
joyously, faced all worlds.</p>
  
  <p>And then my heart was filled with gratitude, with thankfulness, and
 went out in love to all the heroes, the thinkers who gave for the 
liberty of hand and brain — for the freedom of labor and thought — to 
those who fell in the fierce fields of war, to those who died in 
dungeons bound with chains — to those who proudly mounted scaffold’s 
stairs — to those whose bones were crushed, whose flesh was scarred and 
torn — to those by fire consumed — to all the wise, the good, the brave 
of every land, whose thoughts and deeds have given freedom to the sons 
of men. And then I vowed to grasp the torch that they had held, and hold
 it high, that light might conquer darkness still.</p></blockquote>

 I sincerely hope that my "new atheist" colleagues are not so naive as 
to imagine that actual belief in magic might be the issue here. After 
all, it would be absurd to criticize witchcraft as unscientific, as this
 would ignore the primordial division between mythos and logos. Let me 
see if I have this straight: Belief in demons, the evil eye, and the 
medicinal value of a cannibal feast are perversions of the real 
witchcraft - -which is drenched with meaning, intrinsically wholesome, 
integral to our humanity, and here to stay. Do I have that right?</p></blockquote>

  <p>Despite the fact that you arrived in this world with nothing but an
 unborn Buddha-mind, your partiality for yourselves now makes you want 
to have things move in your own way. You lose your temper, become 
contentious, and then you think, "I haven't lost my temper. That fellow 
won't listen to me. By being so unreasonable he has made me lose it." 
And so you fix belligerently on his words and end up transforming the 
valuable Buddha-mind into a fighting spirit. By stewing over this 
unimportant matter, making the thoughts churn over and over in your 
mind, you may finally get your way, but then you fail in your ignorance 
to realize that it was meaningless for you to concern yourself over such
 a matter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Witching was turning out to be mostly hard work and really short on 
magic of the zap!-glingle-glingle-glingle variety. There was no school 
and nothing that was exactly like a lesson. But it wasn’t wise to try to
 learn witching all by yourself, especially if you had a natural talent.
 If you got it wrong, you could go from ignorant to cackling in a week 
...</p>

<p>When you got right down to it, it was all about cackling. No one ever
 talked about this, though. Witches said things like “You can never be 
too old, too skinny, or too warty,” but they never mentioned the 
cackling. Not properly. They watched out for it, though, all the time.</p>

<p>It was all too easy to become a cackler. Most witches lived by 
themselves (cat optional) and might go for weeks without ever seeing 
another witch. In those times when people hated witches, they were often
 accused of talking to their cats. Of course they talked to their cats. 
After three weeks without an intelligent conversation that wasn’t about 
cows, you’d talk to the wall. And that was an early sign of cackling.</p>

<p>“Cackling,” to a witch, didn’t just mean nasty laughter. It meant 
your mind drifting away from its anchor. It meant you losing your grip. 
It meant loneliness and hard work and responsibility and other people’s 
problems driving you crazy a little bit at a time, each bit so small 
that you’d hardly notice it, until you thought that it was normal to 
stop washing and wear a kettle on your head. It meant you thinking that 
the fact you knew more than anyone else in your village made you better 
than them. It meant thinking that right and wrong were negotiable. And, 
in the end, it meant you “going to the dark,” as the witches said. That 
was a bad road. At the end of that road were poisoned spinning wheels 
and gingerbread cottages.</p>

<p>What stopped this was the habit of visiting. Witches visited other 
witches all the time, sometimes traveling quite a long way for a cup of 
tea and a bun. Partly this was for gossip, of course, because witches 
love gossip, especially if it’s more exciting than truthful. But mostly 
it was to keep an eye on one another.</p>

<p>Today Tiffany was visiting Granny Weatherwax, who was in the opinion 
of most witches (including Granny herself) the most powerful witch in 
the mountains. It was all very polite. No one said, “Not gone bats, 
then?” or “Certainly not! I’m as sharp as a spoon!” They didn’t need to.
 They understood what it was all about, so they talked of other things. 
But when she was in a mood, Granny Weatherwax could be hard work.</p>

<p>Although thought by a madman in the book, there seems to be truth in 
this quote. People often seem to think of the future as a coherent, 
specific story not unlike the one woven by the brain from the past 
events. Unpleasant surprises happen when the real events inevitably 
deviate from those imagined.</p>

  <p>"Nor let him [the ruler] ever believe that a state can always make 
safe choices; on the contrary, let him think that he must make only 
doubtful ones; because this is in the order of things, that one never 
tries to avoid one inconvenience without incurring another; but prudence
 consists of knowing how to recognize the kinds of inconveniences, and 
to take the least sad for good."</p></blockquote>

  <p>It is quite easy to show, decision-theoretically, that the greatest
 chance of survival generally belongs to those who have most of their 
beliefs about things which affect our survival ability true. Philosophy,
 however, is totally irrelevant to survival from an evolutionary point 
of view. Natural selection has no way of weeding out veridical 
intuitions about the basic constitution of matter, for instance, from 
false ones, because humans have not generally been killed before they 
can procreate due to having erroneous metaphysical intuitions. Or 
bluntly put: having a true metaphysical theory does not help you getting
 laid.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sounds like a great way to prime yourself. Crossing yourself has
 all the wrong connotations, but a gesture meaning "I choose good." 
should help in general. (I like the fist-over-heart <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> salute.)</p>

<p>Having a whole set of gestures, along with pithy quotes, should prove even more effective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The intellect, as a means for the preservation of the individual, 
unfolds its chief powers in simulation; for this is the means by which 
the weaker, less robust individuals preserve themselves, since they are 
denied the chance of waging the struggle for existence with horns or the
 fangs of beasts of prey. In man this art of simulation reaches its 
peak: here deception, flattering, lying and cheating, talking behind the
 back, posing, living in borrowed splendor, being masked, the disguise 
of convention, acting a role before others and before oneself—in short, 
the constant fluttering around the single flame of vanity is so much the
 rule and the law that almost nothing is more incomprehensible than how 
an honest and pure urge for truth could make its appearance among men. 
They are deeply immersed in illusions and dream images; their eye glides
 only over the surface of things and sees "forms"; their feeling nowhere
 lead into truth, but contents itself with the reception of stimuli, 
playing, as it were, a game of blindman's buff on the backs of things.</p></blockquote>

<p>On specificity and sneaking on connotations; useful for the liberal-minded among us:</p><blockquote><p>I think, with racism and sexism and 'isms' generally, there's a sort of confusion of terminology.</p><p>A
 "Racist1" is someone, who, like a majority of people in this society, 
has subconsciously internalized some negative attitudes about minority 
racial groups. If a Racist1 takes the Implicit Association Test, her 
score shows she's biased against black people, like the majority of 
people (of all races) who took the test. Chances are, whether you know 
it or not, you're a Racist1.</p><p>A "Racist2" is someone who's kind of 
an insensitive jerk about race. The kind of guy who calls Obama the 
"Food Stamp President." Someone you wouldn't want your sister dating.</p><p>A
 "Racist3" is a neo-Nazi. You can never be quite sure that one day he 
won't snap and kill someone. He's clearly a social deviant.</p><p>People
 use the word "Racist" for all three things, and I think that's the 
source of a lot of arguments. When people get accused of being racists, 
they evade responsibility by saying, "Hey, I'm not a Racist3!" when in 
fact you were only saying they were Racist1 or Racist2. But some of the 
responsibility is on the accusers too -- if you say "That Republican's a
 racist" with the implication of "a jerk" and then backtrack and change 
the meaning to "vulnerable to unconscious bias", then you're arguing in 
bad faith. Never mind that some laws and rules which were meant to 
protect people from Racist3's are in fact deployed against Racist2's.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://theferrett.livejournal.com/1717938.html?thread=82991282#t82991282" rel="nofollow">celandine13</a></p>

<blockquote><p>To understand our civilisation, one must appreciate that 
the extended order resulted not from human design or intention but 
spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain 
traditional and largely moral practices, many of which men tend to 
dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose 
validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly 
spread by means of an evolutionary selection — the comparative increase 
of population and wealth — of those groups that happened to follow them.
 The unwitting, reluctant, even painful adoption of these practices kept
 these groups together, increased their access to valuable information 
of all sorts, and enabled them to be 'fruitful, and multiply, and 
replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This process is 
perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.</p></blockquote><p>-- Friedrich Hayek, The Fatal Conceit : The Errors of Socialism (1988), p. 6</p>

<p>An excerpt from Wise Man's Fear, by Patrick Rothfuss. Boxing is not safe.</p><blockquote><p>The
 innkeeper looked up. "I have to admit I don't see the trouble," he said
 apologetically. "I've seen monsters, Bast. The Cthaeh falls short of 
that."</p><p>"That was the wrong word for me to use, Reshi," Bast 
admitted. "But I can't think of a better one. If there was a word that 
meant poisonous and hateful and contagious, I'd use that."</p><p>Bast 
drew a deep breath and leaned forward in his chair. "Reshi, the Cthaeh 
can see the future. Not in some vague, oracular way. It sees <em>all</em> the future. Clearly. Perfectly. Everything that can possibly come to pass, branching out endlessly from the current moment."</p><p>Kvothe raised an eyebrow. "It can, can it?"</p><p>"It
 can," Bast said gravely. "And it is purely, perfectly malicious. This 
isn't a problem for the most part, as it can't leave the tree. But when 
someone comes to visit..."</p><p>Kvothe's eyes went distant as he nodded
 to himself. "If it knows the future perfectly," he said slowly, "then 
it must know exactly how a person will react to anything it says."</p><p>Bast nodded. "And it is vicious, Reshi."</p><p>Kvothe continued in a musing tone. "That means anyone influenced by the Cthaeh would be like an arrow shot into the future."</p><p>"An
 arrow only hits on person, Reshi." Bast's dark eyes were hollow and 
hopeless. "Anyone influenced by the Cthaeh is like a plague ship sailing
 for a harbor." Bast pointed at the half-filled sheet Chronicler held in
 his lap. "If the Sithe knew that existed, they would spare no effort to
 destroy it. They would kill us for having heard what the Cthaeh said."</p><p>"Because
 anything carrying the Cthaeh's influence away from the tree..." Kvothe 
said, looking down at his hands. He sat silently for a long moment, 
nodding thoughtfully. "So a young man seeking his fortune goes to the 
Cthaeh and takes away a flower. The daughter of the king is deathly ill,
 and he takes the flower to heal her. They fall in love despite the fact
 that she's betrothed to the neighboring prince..."</p><p>Bast stared at Kvothe, watching blankly as he spoke.</p><p>"They
 attempt a daring moonlight escape," Kvothe continued. "But he falls 
from the rooftops and they're caught. The princess is married against 
her will and stabs the neighboring prince on their wedding night. The

<pre><code>The Perfect Way is only difficult
for those who pick and choose;
Do not like, do not dislike;
all will then be clear.
Make a hairbreadth difference,
and Heaven and Earth are set apart;
if you want the truth to stand clear before you,
never be for or against.
The struggle between "for" and "against"
is the mind's worst disease.

<blockquote><p>A common mistake is to suppose that scientists are such 
admirable people that they can be safely entrusted with the ultimate 
responsibil­ity for guiding scientific research. In fact they are no 
more admirable than any other type of worker. Neither selection nor 
self-selection tor a scientific career is based on admirableness. Though
 the conventions and protocols of science enforce on scientists, in 
comparison to astrologers and English professors—and lawyers—a high 
degree of objec­tivity when they are doing science, it does not follow 
that such indi­viduals can be depended on to be objective policy 
analysts. That is a role for which they are not trained (but is anyone?)
 and that does not impose the constraints that science imposes.</p></blockquote><p>Richard Posner, <em>Catastrophe: Risk and Response</em></p>

<blockquote><p>It is neither desirable nor any longer effective to try 
bullying people into accepting the authority of science. Instead, all 
members of the educated public can be invited to participate in science,
 in order to experience the true nature and value of scientific inquiry.
 This does not mean listening to professional scientists tell 
condescending stories about how they have discovered wonderful things, 
which you should believe for reasons that are too difficult for you to 
understand in real depth and detail. Doing science ought to mean asking 
your own questions, making your own investigations, and drawing your own
 conclusions for your own reasons. Of course it will not be feasible to 
advance the "cutting edge" or "frontier" of modern science without first
 acquiring years of specialist training. However, the cutting edge is 
not all there is to science, nor is it necessarily the most valuable 
part of science. Questions that have been answered are still worth 
asking again, so you can understand for yourself how to arrive at the 
standard answers, and possibly discover new answers or recover forgotten
 answers that are valuable.</p></blockquote><p>Hasok Chang, <em>Inventing Temperature: Measurement and Scientific Progress</em></p>

<blockquote><p>You can't possibly get a good technology going without an
 enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at 
bicycles, there were thousands of weird models built and tried before 
they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle 
theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, 
it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even 
difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial 
and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.</p></blockquote><p>-- Freeman Dyson</p>

<blockquote><p>If you will learn to work with the system, you can go as 
far as the system will support you ... By realizing you have to use the 
system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how
 to adapt the system to your desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a
 small undeclared war, for the whole of your life ... Very few of you 
have the ability to both reform the system and become a first-class

<blockquote><p>But consider: Newton has thought things that no man 
before has ever thought. A great accomplishment to be sure. Perhaps the 
greatest achievement any human mind has ever made. Very well - what does
 that say of Newton, and of us? Why, that his mind is framed in such a 
way that it can out-think anyone else's. So all hail Isaac Newton! Let 
us give him his due, and glorify and worship whatever generative force 
can frame such a mind.</p><p>Now consider Hooke. Hooke has perceived 
things that no man before us has ever perceived. What does that say of 
Hooke, and of us? That Hooke was framed in some special way? No, for 
just look at you, Robert - by your leave, you are stooped, asthmatic, 
fitful, beset by aches and ills, your eyes and ears are no better than 
those of men who've not perceived a thousandth part of what you have.</p><p>Newton
 makes his discoveries in geometrical realms, where our minds cannot go,
 he strolls in a walled garden filled with wonders, to which he has the 
only key. But you Hooke, are cheek-by-jowl with all of humanity in the 
streets of London. Anyone can look at the things you have looked at. But
 in those things you see what no one else has. You are the millionth 
human to look at a spark, a flea, a raindrop, the moon, and the first to
 see it. For anyone to say that this is less remarkable than what Newton
 has done, is to understand things in but a hollow and jejune way, 'tis 
like going to a Shakespeare play and remembering only the sword fights.</p></blockquote><p>Daniel Waterhouse says to Hooke in Neal Stephenson's <em>Quicksilver</em></p>

<blockquote><p>the designers of a theoretical technology in any but the 
most predictable of areas should identify its assumptions and claims 
that have not already been tested in a laboratory. They should design 
not only the technology but also a map of the uncertainties and edge

would progressively reduce these uncertainties. A proposal that lacks 
this admission of uncertainties coupled with designs of experiments that
 will reduce such uncertainties should not be deemed credible for the

are shut up in a madhouse. It does not concern any of them to discover 
what sort of madness afflicts his neighbor, or the previous occupants of
 his cell; but it matters very much to us. The human mind is less prone

 time to the study of our aberrations.</p></blockquote><p>Bernard de Fontenelle,1686</p><p>Found in <a href="http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=1771" rel="nofollow">book review</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The reason that testability is not enough is that 
prediction is not, and cannot be, the purpose of science. Consider an 
audience watching a conjuring trick. The problem facing them has much 
the same logic as a scientific problem. Although in nature there is no 
conjurer trying to deceive us intentionally, we can be mystified in both
 cases for essentially the same reason: appearances are not 
self-explanatory. If the explanation of a conjuring trick were evident 
in its appearance, there would be no trick. If the explanations of 
physical phenomena were evident in their appearance, empiricism would be
 true and there would be no need for science as we know it. The problem 
is not to predict the trick's appearance. I may, for instance predict 
that if a conjurer seems to place various balls under various cups, 
those cups will later appear to be empty; and I may predict that if the 
conjurer appears to saw someone in half, that person will later appear 
on stage unharmed. Those are testable predictions. I may experience many
 conjuring shows and see my predictions vindicated every time. But that 
does not even address, let alone solve, the problem of how the trick 
works. Solving it requires an explanation: a statement of the reality 
which accounts for the trick's appearance.</p></blockquote><p>David Deutsch, <em>The Beginning of Infinity</em></p>

  <p>We're descended from the indignant, passionate tellers of half

themselves. Over generations success had winnowed us out, and with 
success came our defect, carved deep in the genes like ruts in a cart 
track—when it didn't suit us we couldn't agree on what was in front of 
us. Believing is seeing. That's why there are divorces, border disputes 
and wars, and why this statue of the Virgin Mary weeps blood and that 
one of Ganesh drinks milk. And that was why metaphysics and scince were 
such courageous enterprises, such startling inventions, bigger than the 
wheel, bigger than agriculture, human artifacts set right against the 
grain of human nature.</p></blockquote>

  <p>[Mathematical methods of inference] literally have no content; long
 division can calculate miles per gallon, or it can calculate income per
 capita. The statistical tools of experimental psychology were borrowed 
from agronomy, where they were invented to gauge the effects of 
different fertilizers on crop yields. The tools work just fine in 
psychology, even though, as one psychological statistician wrote, "we do
 not deal in manure, at least not knowingly."</p></blockquote>

<p>The master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the 
papers from him. His calculations were already finished. In a small 
white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him 
awake and active for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, 
patient as ever, he had given his lecture to his students, and then had 
come back at once to this momentous calculation. His face was grave, a 
little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity. For some time he 
seemed lost in thought. Then he went to the window, and the blind went 
up with a click. Half way up the sky, over the clustering roofs, 
chimneys and steeples of the city, hung the star.</p>

<p>He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. 
"You may kill me," he said after a silence. "But I can hold you--and all
 the universe for that matter--in the grip of this little brain. I would
 not change. Even now."</p>

<p>-- H.G. Wells, "The Star", 1897</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>„The hard part is actually being rational, which requires that you 
postpone the fun but currently irrelevant arguments until the pressing 
problem is solved, even perhaps with the full knowledge that you are 
actually probably giving them up entirely. Delaying gratification in 
this manner is not a unique difficulty faced by transhumanists.  Anyone 
pursuing a long-term goal, such as a medical student or PhD candidate, 
does the same.  The special difficulty that you will have to overcome is
 the difficulty of staying on track in the absence of social support or 
of appreciation of the problem, and the difficulty of overcoming your 
mind’s anti-religion defenses, which will be screaming at you to cut out
 the fantasy and go live a normal life, with the normal empty set of 
beliefs about the future and its potential.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quotation - yes, but how differently persons quote! I am as much 
informed of your genius by what you select, as by what you originate. I 
read the quotation with your eyes,  find a new  fervent sense... For 
good quoting, then, there must be originality in the quoter - bent, 
bias, delight in the truth,  only valuing the author in the measure of 
his agreement with the truth which we see,  which he had the luck to see
 first. And originality, what is that? It is being; being somebody, 
being yourself,  reporting accurately what you see  are. If another's 
words describe your fact, use them as freely as you use the language  
the alphabet, whose use does not impair your originality. Neither will 
another's sentiment or distinction impugn your sufficiency. Yet in 
proportion to your reality of life  perception, will be your difficulty 
of finding yourself expressed in others' words or deeds.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their judgment was based more upon blind wishing than upon any sound
  prevision; for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what
  they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not
  fancy.</p></blockquote>

<p>-- Thucydides, Greek Historian, ca. 5th century BCE (Book IV, 108)</p>

<p>I like Thucydides for the way he tries to explain history in terms of
real-politik, people, their drives and especially without including the gods in
an explanation, somewhat similar to Hippocrates.</p>

<p>Interestingly, a modern version of this appeared in Neal Stephenson's <em>Anathem</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never believe a thing simply because you want it to be true</p></blockquote>

<p>where it's called <em>Diax's Rake</em>.</p>

<p>Anathem is a great book, I'd like to add, and quite well aligned with many of
the LW themes.</p>

  <p>In short, whatever emotional impulse we may have toward altruism 
and empathy, and to whatever extent it may be genetically hardwired, it 
does not obviate the need for explicit judgments about right and wrong. 
 If it did not seem <em>correct</em> to act with kindness and fairness, 
even at a net personal cost—if there were no sensible reason for so 
acting, beyond a raw impulse to do so—then we would have reason to 
regard the raw impulse as pointlessly self-destructive—like a 
disposition to alcoholism or a purely visceral (so to speak) aversion to
 surgery—and we would have a reason to attempt to overcome it.</p></blockquote>

  <p>"The usual touchstone of whether what someone asserts is mere 
persuasion or at least a subjective conviction, i.e., firm belief, is 
betting. Often someone pronounces his propositions with such confident 
and inflexible defiance that he seems to have entirely laid aside all 
concern for error. A bet disconcerts him. Sometimes he reveals that he 
is persuaded enough for one ducat but not for ten. For he would happily 
bet one, but at ten he suddenly becomes aware of what he had not 
previously noticed, namely that it is quite possible that he has erred."</p></blockquote>

useless, inaccessible forms of the same quantity. That is not to say 
that these three processes don't have fringe benefits: taxes pay for 
roads and schools; the second law of thermodynamics drives cars, 
computers and metabolism; and death, at the very least, opens up tenured

  <p>quoted text The art of concluding from experience and observation 
consists in evaluating probabilities, in estimating if they are high or 
numerous enough to constitute proof. This type of calculation is more 
complicated and more difficult than one might think. It demands a great 
sagacity generally above the power of common people. The success of 
charlatans, sorcerors, and alchemists — and all those who abuse public 
credulity — is founded on errors in this type of calculation.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Reason is the faculty that identifies and integrates the material 
provided by man’s senses. It is a faculty that man has to exercise by 
choice. Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of 
his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking 
requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one’s 
consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, 
purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let 
himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance 
stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected 
sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational 
connections it might happen to make.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Now let's talk about efficient market theory, a wonderful
 economic doctrine that had a long vogue in spite of the experience of 
Berkshire Hathaway. In fact, one of the economists who won--he shared a 
Nobel Prize--and as he looked at Berkshire Hathaway year after year, 
which people would throw in his face as saying maybe the market isn't 
quite as efficient as you think, he said, "Well, it's a two-sigma 
event." And then he said we were a three-sigma event. And then he said 
we were a four-sigma event. And he finally got up to six sigmas--better 
to add a sigma than change a theory, just because the evidence comes in 
differently. [Laughter] And, of course, when this share of a Nobel Prize
 went into money management himself, he sank like a stone.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://www.rbcpa.com/Mungerspeech_june_95.pdf" rel="nofollow">Charlie Munger</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose you know a golfer's score on day 1 and are asked 
to predict his score on day 2. You expect the golfer to retain the same 
level of talent on the second day, so your best guesses will be "above 
average" for the [better-scoring] player and "below average" for the 
[worse-scoring] player. Luck, of course, is a different matter. Since 
you have no way of predicting the golfers' luck on the second (or any) 
day, your best guess must be that it will be average, neither good nor 
bad. This means that in the absence of any other information, your best 
guess about the players' score on day 2 should not be a repeat of their 
performance on day 1. ...</p><p>The best predicted performance on day 2 
is more moderate, closer to the average than the evidence on which it is
 based (the score on day 1). This is why the pattern is called 
regression to the mean. The more extreme the original score, the more 
regression we expect, because an extremely good score suggests a very 
lucky day. The regressive prediction is reasonable, but its accuracy is 
not guaranteed. A few of the golfers who scored 66 on day 1 will do even
 better on the second day, if their luck improves. Most will do worse, 
because their luck will no longer be above average.</p><p>Now let us go 
against the time arrow. Arrange the players by their performance on day 2
 and look at their performance on day 1. You will find precisely the 
same pattern of regression to the mean. ... The fact that you observe 
regression when you predict an early event from a later event should 
help convince you that regression does not have a causal explanation.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Daniel Kahneman, <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></li></ul>

<blockquote><p>For a hundred years or so, mathematical statisticians 
have been in love with the fact that the probability distribution of the
 sum of a very large number of very small random deviations almost 
always converges to a normal distribution. ... This infatuation tended 
to focus interest away from the fact that, for real data, the normal 
distribution is often rather poorly realized, if it is realized at all. 
We are often taught, rather casually, that, on average, measurements 
will fall within ±σ of the true value 68% of the time, within ±2σ 95% of
 the time, and within ±3σ 99.7% of the time. Extending this, one would 
expect a measurement to be off by ±20σ only one time out of 2 × 10^88.

 trait.</p><p>Why? Because when your goal is mass murder, corruption 
saves lives. Corruption leads you to take the easy way out, to 
compromise, to go along to get along. Corruption isn't a poison that 
makes everything worse. It's a diluting agent like water. Corruption 
makes good policies less good, and evil policies less evil.</p><p>I've 
read thousands of pages about Hitler. I can't recall the slightest hint 
of "corruption" on his record. Like Robespierre, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and
 Pol Pot, Hitler was a sincerely murderous fanatic. The same goes for 
many of history's leading villains - see Eric Hoffer's classic The True 
Believer. Sincerity is so overrated. If only these self-righteous 
monsters had been corrupt hypocrites, millions of their victims could 
have bargained and bribed their way out of hell.</p></blockquote><p>-- <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/09/incorruptibly_e.html" rel="nofollow">Bryan Caplan</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Chris Cillizza says that [...] the surge in the quantity 
of public polling available creates a confusing fog of numbers in which 
"partisans, who already live in a choose-your-own-political-reality 
world, can select the numbers that comply with their view of the race 
and pooh-pooh the data that suggest anything different."</p><p>That's 
true. But if you actually want to know what's happening in the race the 
increased poll volume makes it clearer not less clear. The sense that 
the polls are "all over the map" is the mistake. You need to think of 
each datapoint as having an associated probability distribution and then
 look at where they overlap. [...] The fact that we now have tons of 
polling that averages out to [a] conclusion means the scope for 
"sampling error" to throw us off is, at this point, tiny. One poll 
showing a lead of the current magnitude would leave us with a ton of 
uncertainty, but a bunch of polls makes the picture pretty clear.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/11/02/more_polling_makes_the_state_of_the_race_clearer.html" rel="nofollow">Matthew Yglesias</a></li></ul>

<blockquote><p>I don't have any previous experience with this sort of 
thing, but judging from what I hear and read, I'm supposed to be asking 
why all this is happening, and why it's happening to me. Honestly, those
 questions are about the farthest thing from my mind.</p><p>Partly, 
that’s because they aren't hard questions. Why does our world have 
gravity? Why does the sun rise in the East? There are technical answers,
 but the metaphysical answer is simple: that’s how reality works. So too
 here. Only in the richest parts of the rich world of the twenty-first 
century could anyone entertain the thought that we should expect long, 
pain-free lives. Suffering and premature death (an odd phrase: what does
 it mean to call death "premature"?) are constant presences in the lives
 of most of the peoples of the Earth, and were routine parts of life for
 generations of our predecessors in this country—as they still are 
today, for those with their eyes open. Stage 4 cancers happen to 
middle-aged men and women, seemingly out of the blue, because that's how
 reality works.</p><p>As for why this is happening to me in particular, 
the implicit point of the question is an argument: I deserve better than
 this. There are two responses. First, I don't—I have no greater moral 
claim to be free from unwanted pain and loss than anyone else. Plenty of
 people more virtuous than I am suffer worse than I have, and some who 
don't seem virtuous at all skate through life with surprising ease. 
Welcome to the world. Once again, it seems to me that this claim arises 
from the incredibly unusual experience of a small class of wealthy 
professionals in the wealthiest parts of the world today. We think we 
live in a world governed by merit and moral desert. It isn't so. Luck, 
fortune, fate, providence—call it what you will, but whatever your 
preferred label, it has far more to do with the successes of the 
successful than what any of us deserves. Aristocracies of the past 
awarded wealth and position based on the accident of birth. Today's 
meritocracies award wealth and position based on the accident of being 
in the right place at the right time. The difference is smaller than we 
tend to think. Once you understand that, it’s hard to maintain a sense 
of grievance in the face of even the ugliest medical news. I’ve won more
 than my share of life's lotteries. It would seem churlish to rail at 
the unfairness of losing this one—if indeed I do lose it: which I may 
not.</p><p>The second response is simpler; it comes from the movie 
"Unforgiven." Gene Hackman is dying, and says to Clint Eastwood: "I 
don't deserve this. To die like this. I was building a house." Eastwood 
responds: "Deserve’s got nothing to do with it."</p><p>That gets it 
right, I think. It's a messed-up world, upside-down as often as it's 
rightside up. Bad things happen; future plans (that house Hackman was 
building) come to naught. Deserve's got nothing to do with it.</p></blockquote><p>--William J. Stuntz, <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/blogs/dskeel/archives/2008/04/more_cancerstuntz.html" rel="nofollow">discussing</a> his cancer diagnosis</p><p>Apologies
 for the length, but I wanted to include the full substantive point and 
hated to snip lines here and there. For what it's worth, Prof. Stuntz 
was a devout Christian, and the linked post went on to discuss his 
theological views on why "something deep within us expects, even demands
 moral order—in a world that shouts from the rooftops that no such order
 exists." Obviously I draw a different conclusion about this conflict, 
but I still respect that he could take such an unflinching view of how 
morally empty nature really is.</p>

<blockquote><p>I notice with some amusement, both in America and English
 literature, the rise of a new kind of bigotry. Bigotry does not consist
 in a man being convinced he is right; that is not bigotry, but sanity. 
Bigotry consists in a man being convinced that another man must be wrong
 in everything, because he is wrong in a particular belief; that he must
 be wrong, even in thinking that he honestly believes he is right.</p></blockquote><p>-G. K. Chesterton</p>

<blockquote><p>It is startling to realize how much unbelief is necessary
 to make belief possible. What we know as blind faith is sutained by 
innnumerable unbeliefs: the fanatical Japanese in Brazil refused to 
believe for years the evidence of Japan's defeat; the fanatical 
Communist refuses to believe any unfavorable reports or evidence about 
Russia, nor will he be disillusioned by seeing with his own eyes the 
cruel misery inside the Soviet promised land.</p><p>It is the true 
believer's ability to "shut his eyes and stop his ears" to facts that do
 not deserve to be either seen or heard which is the source of his 
unequaled fortitude and constancy. He can not be frightened by danger, 
nor disheartened by obstacles nor baffled by contradictions because he 
denies their existence. Strength of faith, as Bergson pointed out, 
manifests itself not in moving mountains, but in not seeing mountains to
 move.</p></blockquote><p>-- Eric Hoffer, <em>The True Believer</em></p>

<blockquote><p>I have always had an animal fear of death, a fate I rank 
second only to having to sit through a rock concert. My wife tries to be
 consoling about mortality and assures me that death is a natural part 
of life, and that we all die sooner or later. Oddly this news, whispered
 into my ear at 3 a.m., causes me to leap screaming from the bed, snap 
on every light in the house and play my recording of “The Stars and 
Stripes Forever” at top volume till the sun comes up.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/hypochondria-an-inside-look.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0" rel="nofollow">Woody Allen</a>

<blockquote><p>I find for myself that my first thought is never my best 
thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what 
I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. 
It’s only by concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, 
letting all the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an 
original idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw 
connections, take me by surprise. And often even that idea doesn’t turn 
out to be very good. I need time to think about it, too, to make 
mistakes and recognize them, to make false starts and correct them, to 
outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and 
move on to the next thing.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/" rel="nofollow">William Deseriewicz</a></p><p>The whole speech is worth reading as one giant rationality quote</p>

<blockquote><p>[O]ur moral judgments are less reliable than many would 
hope, and this has specific implications for methodology in normative 
ethics. Three sources of evidence indicate that our intuitive ethical 
judgments are less reliable than we might have hoped: a historical 
record of accepting morally absurd social practices; a scientic record 
showing that our intuitive judgments are systematically governed by a 
host of heuristics, biases, and irrelevant factors; and a philosophical 
record showing deep, probably unresolvable, inconsistencies in common 
moral convictions. I argue that this has the following implications for 
moral theorizing: we should trust intuitions less; we should be 
especially suspicious of intuitive judgments that t a bias pattern, 
even when we are intuitively condent that these judgments are not a 
simple product of the bias; we should be especially suspicious of 
intuitions that are part of inconsistent sets of deeply held 
convictions; and we should evaluate views holistically, thinking of 
entire classes of judgments that they get right or wrong in broad 
contexts, rather than dismissing positions on the basis of a small 
number of intuitive counterexamples.</p></blockquote><p>Nick Beckstead, <em>On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future</em>, University of Rutgers, New Brunswick, 2013, p. 19</p>

<blockquote><p>When philosophers use a word—"knowledge", "being", 
"object", "I", "proposition", "name"—and try to grasp the essence of the
 thing, one must always ask oneself: is the word ever actually used in 
this way in the language-game which is its original home?—What we do is 
to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use. You 
say to me: "You understand this expression, don't you? Well then—I am 
using it in the sense you are familiar with."— As if the sense were an 
atmosphere accompanying the word, which it carried with it into every 
kind of application.</p></blockquote><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein, <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> 116-117</p>

<p>On not doing the impossible:</p><blockquote><p>Ferrucci says. “We 
constantly underestimate—we did in the ’50s about AI, and we’re still 
doing it—what is really going on in the human brain.”</p><p>The question
 that [Douglas] Hofstadter wants to ask Ferrucci, and everybody else in 
mainstream AI, is this: Then why don’t you come study it?</p><p>...</p><p>Peter
 Norvig, one of Google’s directors of research, echoes Ferrucci almost 
exactly. “I thought he was tackling a really hard problem,” he told me 
about Hofstadter’s work. “And I guess I wanted to do an easier problem.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/?fb_action_ids=600308476701238&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=%5B642164009161093%5D&amp;action_type_map=%5B%22og.likes%22%5D&amp;action_ref_map=%5B%5D" rel="nofollow">Article at The Atlantic</a></p>
