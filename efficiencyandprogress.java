/* Demonstration of dead-code elimination in the JVM.
 * 
 * This class demonstrates some of the difficulties of benchmarking
 * code which may be subject to dead-code elimination by the JVM.
 * There are two loops, both calling the same function. But only the
 * second loop actually uses the result of the function.
 *
 * When I run this code, I get results like this:
 *
 * Dead code:
 * Computed 10000.0 in 108 msecs
 * Computed 10000.0 in 22 msecs
 * Computed 10000.0 in 0 msecs      // dead-code elimination
 * Computed 10000.0 in 0 msecs
 * Computed 10000.0 in 0 msecs
 * 
 * Live code:
 * Computed 4.9995E11 in 92 msecs
 * Computed 4.9995E11 in 92 msecs
 * Computed 4.9995E11 in 96 msecs
 * Computed 4.9995E11 in 93 msecs
 * Computed 4.9995E11 in 92 msecs
 *
 * However, if I swap the order of the two loops, they both run at the
 * same speed! Maybe because by that point the JVM has already
 * optimized the 'sum' function so it doesn't bother to eliminate it.
