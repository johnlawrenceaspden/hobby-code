* Checklist
Keep Fire In / Internal temperature above 0
Keep Batteries Charged above 12.2volts/50%. 
Top up water/empty sewage if necessary. (Should last around two weeks if you're careful)
Please don't let dogs on boat, I am allergic and will blame you for every sniffle for the next five years if I find dog hairs.


* Major Threats
** Fire
*** aboard
Careful not to leave anything flammable on or near the fire, or allow it to run out of control.  
Don't leave the boat without checking the stove and cooker.
There are three fire extinguishers, notice where they are. CALL FIRE BRIGADE FIRST.
*** chimney fire
Can be caused if there's flammable layer inside stove pipe. Becomes blast furnace. Quite spectacular apparently, and can destroy boat.
Close all vents tight to reduce amount of air going in, and SUMMON FIRE BRIGADE. 
** Carbon Monoxide
Various detectors throughout boat. Fire shouldn't make CO unless banked very low. 
Levels below 30 ppm are not dangerous. But in high concentrations it's deadly, invisible and doesn't smell of anything.
All you will feel is sleepy, and when you wake up you will be dead.
Do not ignore carbon monoxide detector alerts! ( I have had only one in five years, and it was because the chimney had blocked and the boat was filling with deadly gas )
** Gas Explosion
Boat Gas (propane) is very dangerous, heavier than air, so it builds up in bilges. 
If the bilges are full of gas then you're aboard a floating bomb.
Careful not to leave gas on unlit, learn smell, which is not the same as house gas.
** Burst Pipes
Temperatures below zero will burst water pipes and calorifier, Â£1000s of damage, keep the fire in all the time if it's cold
** Flooding
Happens every year, not usually a problem, check that the mooring spikes are in solidly.
If the water covers the spikes it can wash them free, so if that happens I usually put in extra spikes in higher ground.
The big danger is when the water goes back down!
When the water goes back down the boat must be in the river. If it sits on the bank it will overturn and sink. 
Once it's caught it's impossible to move it off because it weighs 26 tons.
Cure is scaffold poles between bank and boat. There are three permanently driven into the river bed where Katy is moored. 
If the water starts to rise, check that the poles are driven firmly into the river bed.
*Get help* if it starts to flood or rains heavily for a long time. 
Usually just wearing wellies to get on and off is good enough, but if it's really bad you can use the gangplank.
Make sure the sandpaper side of the gangplank is upwards, and put a towel under it to protect the paintwork.
** Crashing
Hull is solid. You'd have to work quite hard to damage it. But...
Boat weighs 26tons. Even moving very slowly it will crush arms and legs between it and the bank. Hitting a plastic cruiser will shatter it.
Don't move her in strong stream or wind. Go slow and careful. When turning round, do a three point turn with as many points as necessary. Turn very gently and don't let her hit either bank as this can break things inside.
If the stream is strong, you'll get washed downriver a long way while turning, so take a look what's downstream before you start. I got wedged across the bridge supports in Ely once
** Stern Gland
Remember to retighten grease injector every time prop has turned. Leaking stern gland and clogged pump/dead battery can sink boat.


* Minor Threats
** Toilet
*Never* put anything down a boat toilet that you haven't eaten. Carefully selected soft toilet paper is also ok.
Anything else will instantly jam the mechanism. Repair needs a plumber, extensive destruction and probably new parts ordered from Italy.
** Discharged Batteries
   Batteries in low charge state are damaged by it. If you notice voltage less than 12.2 unloaded / less than 50%, run engine until back to 80%/when charging stops
   Engine needs throttle blipped gently to 'prime' alternator. If it's not going then the rev counter will be dead and the yellow battery light will be on. When alternator is running with engine idle it should be putting 20A into the batteries, and the battery meter should show this. If the initial throttle blip doesn't start it, leave the engine running gently for a few minutes and try again. I don't know why this is. Maybe there is damp in the alternator and it needs to warm up before it will start working?
** Water Pump Burnout
If you run out of water, the pump will run continuously, which will burn it out. Switch it off in fuse cupboard.
** Water Leak
Any water leak, turn off the water pump and also the stopcock in left hand front cupboard.
** Sewage Tank
First sign of sewage tank getting full is a nasty smell in the bedroom, empty tank ASAP before anything gross happens. 
When it's full, toilet won't flush. Careful not to cause it to overflow.
** Burglars
Not much of a problem apparently, but I leave the bank side and front door curtains shut usually so that no-one can see in. 
I leave the front cabin lights on when I go out, they only draw 0.5 amp so even in winter the solar panels can usually cope.
Don't leave hatch open when going out, since it's possible that someone will notice and climb round/over. It's easy to see from the bridge/other side of the river.

* Stove
** remove ash every time you put new coal on
Careful not to spill hot ash, I've already made two holes in the carpet.

The Guardian is exactly the right size to lay in front of the fire to keep ash off the floor when messing. When done, fold up the top sheet of paper and bin it.

Ash goes into ash box, then when cooled empty the box into the bin on the common. 
Only once it's cold though, or it will set fire to the bin bags.

It's best to put the ash box horizontally on top of the fire, put the ash pan in the box, and then close the lid on the lot. This stops loads of burnt coal dust ('fly ash') from getting spread around.

Suck up spilt dust with hoover. Don't use brush, it just makes it worse.

** Normal usage 
If you open the vents and go out or leave the ashpit door open for long you'll burn down the boat!

Regulate heat by controlling amount of air allowed in. 
Unless trying to revive dead fire/lighting new one, have all vents closed and use the screw to control how much air can sneak in.
Keep top vents (for wood burning) and slider closed. Careful of slider, can open without you noticing.
Don't worry about how much coal you use. It's very cheap and I've got lots. Keep warm.

usual screw settings (roughly, depends how much ash is clogging it up)
fully closed: fire may go out. don't use.
tau/8 / 45 degrees: fire will stay in for 12hours+, doesn't put out much heat. 
tau/4 / 90 degrees:  usual setting unless it's very cold
tau/2 / 180 degrees: fire will be very hot, but coal will all be used up in a few hours.
** if fire is drawing too much air
It shouldn't do. It's properly sealed, but if it does you can:
Put a layer of ash on top of the burning coal to calm it down
Put cardboard strips in the ash pit vents to make a better seal

If it gets away from you, take everything flammable away from the fire, and put ash on top of the coal to form a blanket and calm it down. If it's looking dangerous or out of control CALL THE FIRE BRIGADE before anything dreadful happens.

** relighting if it goes out
Should the fire go out, don't remove the ash or unburnt coal. Make a little hole in the coal, put a firelighter in the hole and then put a couple of pieces of kindling wood on top to make a 'combustion chamber'. Light the firelighter, then put coal on top of the wood.

It's difficult to light wet coal directly. Make sure there's always some coal in the bucket drying out so you don't end up with a dead fire and only wet coal to light it with. If you find yourself with no dry coal then try the blue plastic bucket which is usually in the foredeck well or on the bank next to the boat. There should be some dry coal there for emergency use.


* Electricity
Powers everything. Enough from solar panels even in mid-winter to power systems, cabin lights, radio.

Battery monitor on cupboard door at sleeping cabin end. 12.6 volt is fully charged, 12.2 is half-charged. Don't let it get that low.

Fridge is huge consumer of electricity and mid winter it draws more power than the solar panels can provide.

You can make more electricity by running the engine when the batteries are low. Wait until the engine is warmed up before revving it up with the (red) neutral button pressed in to make the alternator work. RPM indicator will read zero, and yellow battery light will be on unless alternator is generating electricity.

Starter battery is a separate circuit so even if the main batteries are very low the engine should start. A running alternator charges both.

* Lights
The lights in the front cabin roof are all LEDs. These draw very small amounts of power so you can have them on for hours.
Some of the other lights are incandescents. Don't leave them on too long as it drains batteries. 

* Hot Water
Produced as side effect of running engine. But I find it easier to make small amounts in the kettle, and take showers elsewhere.

There's also a little eberspacher water heater which burns diesel to heat water. Run that for half an hour and you should have enough hot water for a shower. The eberspacher will only work if the battery voltage is high enough, so if it doesn't, run the engine to charge the batteries and that will also make hot water as it runs.

* Shower
I avoid using it in cold weather. It makes lots of condensation, runs down the water tank, and you need to heat the water first.
Boathouse showers more convenient in all ways. But feel free if you'd like to.

Run the engine or the eberspacher for a half hour or so to make enough hot water (maybe go cruising or to the water point).

Turn on extractor fan and drain pump while showering (two different switches on wall near shower)

* Refilling with water
hex key handle opens water inlet in foredeck.

I have a nice new hose on a reel and a separate endpiece to go in the water tank which makes it much easier than it used to be. 

CLEAN THE END OF THE HOSE BEFORE YOU PUT IT ANYWHERE NEAR THE FRESH WATER TANK. 
CAREFUL NOT TO GET LEAVES/DIRT ETC IN WATER TANK AS THERE'S NO WAY TO GET THEM OUT.

* Sewage pump-out
DO AFTER THE WATER to avoid danger of contaminating fresh water tank.
Wear rubber gloves, hex key opens sewage tank on port side.
EA key opens sewage pump house at top of bank, where you put the money in.
Connect hose, close valve, insert Â£3, wait for pressure gauge to build up, open valve.

Sometimes there's no pressure. That means it's buggered. Phone council. They usually fix it quickly. 
Usually you can fix it yourself by sucking water out of the river which will clean the pipe and pump. It will suck sluggishly and then suddenly start working properly.

* Fuse cupboard
Usually have all switches on, except for bilge pump and nav lights (which must be off except when in use)
Turn everything off if leaving boat alone for a long time.
Main use is to disable water pump in event of running out of water, but you also lose the front sockets and radio on the same switch.

* Fridge
Uses loads of power, you'll need to run the engine occasionally if you want the fridge on. I don't use it in the Winter. If you put stuff on the back steps or on the front deck in the cold months it won't go off in a hurry.

The fridge switch also controls the incandescent cabin wall lights so they won't work if the fridge is off. But you shouldn't put them on in winter anyway as they use far too much electricity.

* Inverter
Turns 12v into 240v, can be used for mobile chargers, laptops, although I have 12v versions. Main use is for DAB radio, although boat FM radio is better and uses less power.
The inverter draws power just by being on, so always switch it off when you've finished using it.
