;; A Poisson Process

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Imagine a very lot of things, each of which has a very small chance of
;; happening, so that on average, only a few things happen every second.

;; A classic case is radioactivity, where we've got a very large number of
;; atoms, each of which has a very small chance of exploding in any given
;; second.

;; We might know the average number of decays per second without having the
;; slightest idea what the large number or the small chance are.

;; Alternatively, we might just know what the sample did over a one second
;; period, and be trying to guess what the constant is.

;; In probability, we model this situation with a Poisson process.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; This cryptic function gives the probabilities, for a given decay rate l
;; of each of the numbers we might read on our Geiger counter.

;; I'm ashamed to say that although I wrote this function and can prove these
;; are the probabilities, I can't come up with an easy way to explain why it
;; gives the right answers. You have to imagine what the probabilities are for
;; larger and larger numbers but smaller and smaller chances, keeping the
;; average the same, and notice that they settle down as the numbers get
;; bigger. These are the limits:

(defn poisson [l]
  (map first
       (iterate
        (fn [[a c]] [(/(* a l) (inc c)) (inc c)])
        [(Math/exp (- l)) 0])))

;; So let's just take this as the definition of a Poisson process, and have a
;; look at what it means.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Clojure has inherited common lisp's excellent format function, so by casting
;; one cryptic spell we can print out the probabilities for the first few geiger
;; counter readings, if the average decay rate is one click/second.

;; One way of looking at this is to say that if we ran the experiment one
;; hundred times, then we'd expect that 37 times we'd hear no clicks, 37 times
;; we'd get one click, 18 times we'd get two, 6 times we'd get three, and twice
;; we'd get four. Sort of. Although actually we'd be quite surprised if that
;; happened.

;; As a sanity check, let's work out what our expected number of clicks is here.
;; We know it should be one.

;; Neat huh?

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; The philosophical foundations of probability theory are completely incoherent
;; as far as I can tell, so I've always felt free to believe whatever I like as
;; long as it means my intuition leads me to the right answers.

;; I've found that for me, intuition is best served by imagining that we have a
;; vast number of parallel universes, and in them the results of the experiments
;; are spread out in the proportions given by the formula.

;; It's fair to say that this position is controversial.

;; If we take the numbers to three significant figures:

;; Then we'll notice that there are some very rare universes where we get five
;; clicks, or even six from a process where the average number of clicks/second
;; is one.

;; In fact none of the numbers is really zero. There will be some universes
;; where the whole radioactive sample decays at once.  It's probably best not to

;; The way I read this table is:

;; We had a look in several hundred parallel universes where we did the experiment.

;; In thirty seven of them, the star constant was one, and we saw no photons in our detector.

;; In another thirty seven, the star constant was one, but we saw one photon.

;; There were four universes where the star constant was five, and we saw nine photons.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; So what should we believe if we point a photodetector at a star and detect 9
;; photons in one second?

;; Well, what we're trying to do is work out what the star constant is.

;; And what we know is that we're in one of the universes where we counted nine photons.

;; I.e. we know that we're in the last row of the table.

;; Let's have a look at that last row:

(clojure.pprint/cl-format nil "蕃" (map #(nth (poisson %) 9) (range 1 21)))

;; "0.00,0.00,0.00,0.01,0.04,0.07,0.10,0.12,0.13,0.13,0.11,0.09,0.07,0.05,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.00,0.00"

;; What is the total number of the universes that we could be in?
(reduce + (map #(nth (poisson %) 9) (range 1 21)))

;; 0.9963258860986628

;; Call it 100

;; Counting along, we see that there's about a 13% chance that we're in a
;; universe where the constant is 9

;; And about a 13% chance that the constant is 10

;; And a one percent chance that the constant is 4 and that was a particularly lucky second to measure.

;; And a one percent chance that the constant is 18 and it was a particularly bad second to measure in.

;; We might even want to say that there's an 88% chance that the constant is between 6 and 14.

;; Or a half chance that it's 8, 9, 10, or 11

;; As you might have guessed in advance, nine, the number of photons that we
;; actually saw in a second, is probably our best guess at the average number of
;; photons we'll see per second from now on. In classical statistics we'd call
;; that the maximum likelihood estimator, or an unbiased estimator, but in fact
;; there's only a 13% chance that it's the right answer.

;; Probably better just to keep the distribution above in mind.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; What's the expected number of photons per second we'll see if we now run our
;; counter for a while?

;; Remember that we're assuming that stars come in discrete varieties 1-20
;; and that we saw 9 photons.

;; We've seen 9 photons. Surely, given no more information than that, our best

;; Consider some edge cases.

;; What about if the stars are only ever of brightness one?

(expected-rate '(1) 9) ; 1.0

;; That's definitely right. We must have just been really lucky to catch nine
;; photons at once. Since we're *sure* that the star is brightness one, the long
;; term estimate has to be one.

;; Here we're in complete agreement with the maximum likelihood estimator, and
;; disagree violently with the unbiased estimator.

;; What about if stars come in brightnesses 1 or 10?

(expected-rate '(1 10) 9) ; 9.999927072835586

;; Again, fair enough. Chances are it was a brightness 10 star behaving
;; normally, but there's a very small chance that it was a brightness 1 star
;; having a very good second.

;; If we run our experiment often enough, the average value will be pulled down
;; a tiny bit by those cases.

;; What if we saw 5 photons?

(expected-rate '(1 10) 5) ; 9.325386911283335

;; Pretty much the same. But now we have to take more seriously the chance now
;; that it was a weak star having a field day rather than a bright star having a
;; half-hearted go.

;; If you're having to budget for photons for some reason, then 9.32 is an
;; unbelievably bad answer. Your budget is going to need to be 10 or 1 exactly.

;; But if you're placing a bet at a bookmaker's, or buying photon insurance from
;; a company with a presence in lots of parallel universes, then 9.33 might well
;; be a fair price. Everyone's got to make a profit.

(expected-rate '(1 10) 2) ; 1.1097148350481423

;; Same sort of thing. About one time in a hundred, two photons will have been

;; The dodgy case is when we see 4 photons.  Brightness one stars have about a
;; 2% chance of producing 4 photons, and brightness ten stars have about a 2%

;; So half the time, we've got a 1, and half the time, we've got a 10.
