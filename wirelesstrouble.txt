A few things to check, in order:

Does the wireless network device appear?
Check that your wireless adapter appears in the output of ip link. This will print a couple of lines about each of your network interfaces. Check for a wlan0 entry, or something similar.

If your wireless device does not appear, it would indicate that the driver did not recognise your device. Check the dmesg output to see if there's any relevant kernel logs.

Does it look like a proper wireless device?
Run iwconfig; it will probably state that most of your network interfaces have "no wireless extensions", but it should print some wireless-related info (mode/essid/wireless standards supported) for at least one device.

If your wireless device is present but does not list any wireless extentions, this would indicate a problem with the driver. Look for interesing info in dmesg.

If iwconfig prints an error, this could indicate a compatibility problem with the new driver and the userspace tools.

Is Network Manager recognising your wireless device?
Run nm-tool, and make sure that your wireless device is present in the output, and that it has some 'Wireless Properties' listed.

If not, this could indicate an interaction problem between the new driver and the Network Manager build. Check /var/log/syslog for NetworkManager-related entries.

The output of ip link contains information about lo and eth0 not wlan0. The output of dmesg | wl is the following: [ 27.593069] wl: module license 'unspecified' taints kernel., [ 27.600936] wl 0000:0c:00.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 17, [ 27.600945] wl 0000:0c:00.0: setting latency timer to 64 I didn't find any useful infromation in the output of dmesg. Do you have any other suggestions on how to proceed? â€“ reprogrammer Aug 20 '11 at 10:15
