The Python code you've provided uses OpenCV for image processing and performs several tasks, including reading an image, applying edge detection, and detecting straight lines via Hough Transform. Here's the equivalent code in Rust, using the opencv crate, which is a Rust wrapper around the OpenCV library.
Rust Translation of Your Python Code

To run this code in Rust, you need to install the opencv crate. You can add it to your Cargo.toml:

# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
opencv = "0.70.0"

Here's the translated Rust code:

# Rust Code

use opencv::{
    core,
    imgcodecs,
    imgproc,
    highgui,
    prelude::*,
    types,
    Result,
};
use std::{fs, env};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Print current working directory
    println!("Current working directory: {}", env::current_dir()?.display());

    // Change to the desired directory
    env::set_current_dir("/home/john/hobby-code/pytorch")?;
    println!("Changed working directory: {}", env::current_dir()?.display());

    // Read the image
    let img = imgcodecs::imread("1nealclose+20.png", imgcodecs::IMREAD_COLOR)?;

    // Convert to grayscale
    let mut img_gray = Mat::default();
    imgproc::cvt_color(&img, &mut img_gray, imgproc::COLOR_BGR2GRAY, 0)?;

    // Display original image
    highgui::imshow("Original", &img)?;
    // highgui::imshow("Original Gray", &img_gray)?;

    // Blur the image for better edge detection
    let mut img_blur = Mat::default();
    imgproc::gaussian_blur(&img_gray, &mut img_blur, core::Size::new(3, 3), 0.0, 0.0, core::BORDER_DEFAULT)?;

    highgui::imshow("Original Blur", &img_blur)?;

    // Sobel edge detection
    let mut sobel_x = Mat::default();
    imgproc::sobel(&img_blur, &mut sobel_x, core::CV_64F, 1, 0, 5, 1.0, 0.0, core::BORDER_DEFAULT)?;

    let mut sobel_y = Mat::default();
    imgproc::sobel(&img_blur, &mut sobel_y, core::CV_64F, 0, 1, 5, 1.0, 0.0, core::BORDER_DEFAULT)?;

    // Canny edge detection
    let mut edges = Mat::default();
    imgproc::canny(&img_blur, &mut edges, 100.0, 200.0, 3, false)?;

    highgui::imshow("Canny Edge Detection", &edges)?;

    // Perform Hough Line Transform
    let mut lines = types::VectorOfVec2f::new();
    imgproc::hough_lines(&edges, &mut lines, 1.0, core::PI / 180.0, 150.0, 0.0, 0.0)?;

    let mut hough_lines_img = img.clone();
    if !lines.is_empty() {
        for line in lines.iter() {
            let rho = line[0];
            let theta = line[1];

            let a = theta.cos();
            let b = theta.sin();
            let x0 = a * rho;
            let y0 = b * rho;

            let x1 = (x0 + 1000.0 * (-b)) as i32;
            let y1 = (y0 + 1000.0 * a) as i32;
            let x2 = (x0 - 1000.0 * (-b)) as i32;
            let y2 = (y0 - 1000.0 * a) as i32;

            // Draw the line on the image
            imgproc::line(
                &mut hough_lines_img,
                core::Point::new(x1, y1),
                core::Point::new(x2, y2),
                core::Scalar::new(0.0, 0.0, 255.0, 0.0),
                2,
                8,
                0,
            )?;
        }
    }

    highgui::imshow("Hough Lines", &hough_lines_img)?;

    // Wait until the user presses the ESC key
    loop {
        let key = highgui::wait_key(0)?;
        println!(
            "Waiting for ESC (27): You pressed {} (0x{:x}), LSB: {} ({})",
            key,
            key,
            key & 0xFF,
            if key & 0xFF < 128 {
                char::from(key & 0xFF)
            } else {
                '?'.to_string()
            }
        );
        if key == 27 {
            break;
        }
    }

    highgui::destroy_all_windows()?;

    Ok(())
}


Explanation of Changes

    File I/O: In Python, you used os.chdir() to change the current working directory, which is replicated in Rust using std::env::set_current_dir().
    Image Processing:
        We use the opencv crate's functions like imread, cvt_color, gaussian_blur, sobel, and canny to replicate the image processing steps in Python.
        We also use hough_lines to perform the Hough Transform.
    Window Display: The imshow and waitKey functions in OpenCV are used similarly in Rust to display images and handle keypress events.

How to Run

    Install Rust: If you don't have Rust installed, follow the installation guide at https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started.
    Install OpenCV: Make sure you have OpenCV installed on your system. On Ubuntu, you can install it via sudo apt install libopencv-dev.
    Cargo.toml: Add the opencv crate as shown in the Cargo.toml.
    Compile and Run: Run the following command to build and execute your project:


#Bash Code

cargo run

    
Notes

    Make sure to adjust the image path "1nealclose+20.png" to point to the correct image file on your system.
    This translation assumes that your OpenCV installation is correctly set up and that you have access to the necessary image files and libraries.

    Wow, thanks! I am both impressed and terrified...

Haha, I totally get that feeling! It’s pretty amazing how you can go from Python to Rust, but Rust does have that "terrors" factor with its strictness and memory safety guarantees. But once you get used to it, you’ll find that these features can actually be a huge help in catching errors early and writing more reliable, performant code.

If you want to dive deeper into Rust, the learning curve can be a bit steep, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with this project (or any other), feel free to reach out. I’m here to help!

And if you're feeling a bit overwhelmed—totally normal—just take it one step at a time. The Rust community has tons of great resources, too.
